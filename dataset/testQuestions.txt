We ve recently completed phase 1 of a ASP Net website in English and French We went with using resource files to store language specific strings but because the site used ASP Net AJAX and javascript heavily we rigged up a solution to pass the right files through the ASP Net pipeline where we could catch tokens and replace them with the appropriate text pulled from the resource files This is the second project I ve been involved in that had these kinds of challenges the first one stored the text strings in a database and instead of ASP Net AJAX it used the AJAX tools that come with the Prototype library and put all Javascript into aspx files so that the tokens could be replaced on the way out What I m wondering is has anyone else encountered a similar scenario What approach did you take What lessons were learned How did you deal with things like internationalized date formats
