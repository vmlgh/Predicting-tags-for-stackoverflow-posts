I wonder why would a C C Java developer want to learn a dynamic language Assuming the company won t switch its main development language from C C Java to a dynamic one what use is there for a dynamic language What helper tasks can be done by the dynamic languages faster or better after only a few days of learning than with the static language that you have been using for several years Update After seeing the first few responses it is clear that there are two issues My main interest would be something that is justifiable to the employer as an expense That is I am looking for justifications for the employer to finance the learning of a dynamic language Aside from the obvious that the employee will have broader view the employers are usually looking for some real benefit,python

I have a web page that includes a bunch of images Sometimes the image isn t available so a broken image is displayed in the client s browser How do I use jQuery to get the set of images filter it to broken images then replace the src I thought it would be easier to do this with jQuery but it turned out much easier to just use a pure JavaScript solution that is the one provided by Prestaul,html

I m trying to implement a pop up menu based on a click and hold positioned so that a really slow click will still trigger the default action and with the delay set so that a text selection gesture won t usually trigger the menu What I can t seem to do is cancel the text selection in a way that doesn t prevent text selection in the first place returning false from the event handler or calling this preventDefault prevents the user from selecting at all and the obvious trigger mouseup doesn t doesn t do anything with the selection at all This is in the general context of a page not particular to a textarea or other text field e stopPropogation doesn t cancel text selection I m not looking to prevent text selections but rather to veto them after some short period of time if certain conditions are met,html

I m using Webkit sharp to embed Webkit into an application and I need to hook certain links to perform actions in my app rather than their normal action I ve considered using Javascript to iterate over the anchor tags and replace the ones that match with the proper link but I m wondering if this is the best way Is there a preferred way of doing this,html

My understanding is that C C produces native code to run on a particular machine architecture Conversely languages like Java and C run on top of a virtual machine which abstracts away the native architecture Logically it would seem impossible for Java or C to match the speed of C because of this intermediate step however I ve been told that the latest compilers hot spot can attain this speed or even exceed it Perhaps this is more of a compiler question than a language question but can anyone explain in plain English how it is possible for one of these virtual machine languages to perform better than a native language,cpp

I have a table column that needs to be limited to a certain width say 100 pixels At times the text in that column is wider than this and contains no spaces For example a_really_long_string_of_text_like_this_with_no_line_breaks_makes_the_table_unhappy I would like to calculate the width of text server side and add an ellipsis after the correct number of characters The problem is that I don t have data about the rendered size of the text For example assuming the browser was Firefox 3 and the font was 12px Arial What would be the width of the letter a the width of the letter b etc Do you have data showing the pixel width of each character Or a program to generate it I think a clever one time javascript script could do the trick But I don t want to spend time re inventing the wheel if someone else has already done this I am surely not the first person to come up against this problem,html

I ve tried my best to be a purist with my usage of Javascript Ajax techniques ensuring that all Ajax y behavior is an enhancement of base functionality while the site is also fully functional when Javascript is disabled However this causes some problems In some cases a DOM node should only be visible when Javascript is enabled in the browser In other cases it should only be visible when disabled Take for instance a submit button on a form that has a drop down with an onchange handler that auto submits using JQuery s form plugin lt form method post action gt lt label for id_state gt State lt label gt lt select name state id id_state onchange this form ajaxSubmit ajax_submit_handler gt lt option value AL gt Alabama lt option gt lt option value AK gt Alaska lt option gt lt select gt lt input class with_js_disabled type submit value OK gt lt form gt and the Javascript lt script type text javascript gt document ready function with_js_disabled hide lt script gt When Javascript is enabled the submit button is not required due to the onchange handler However JQuery s document ready function and the more direct document onload is only called after the page has been fully loaded and rendered hence the submit button is initially displayed and a flash occurs when the Javascript is executed and the node s display is set to none I ve accepted this as the cost of doing business and haven t found a way around it But is there a technique I m not aware of that will minimize the effect or even outright eliminate it EDIT The lt noscript gt solution mentioned by many people below seems promising but isn t working for me on Safari However Prestaul s 2nd suggestion works beautifully lt body gt lt script type text javascript gt document body className has_js lt script gt lt the rest of your page gt lt body gt This can then be styled using straight CSS body js_enabled_only display none body js_disabled_only display block body has_js js_enabled_only display block body has_js js_disabled_only display none This second line is just for reference and can and should be removed to avoid circumstances where your element shouldn t be display block Likewise you may need different variations on the third line for other display styles But this solution is nice and clean IMO and in my tests entirely eliminates the flicker effect,html

I just started making a PHP AJAX site and I was wondering where I should add the functionality to only include the content Should I have if statements in my header and footer scripts that check for a ContentOnly get parameter And then append that parameter to the query strings in my AJAX calls Or should I use a filter on the AJAX side to only grab the main content Div Like in jquery this load myPhpPage php mainContentDiv The first method would be faster right But the second method would keep the AJAX functionality on the presentation side and out og my PHP Or is there a third method I want to keep my PHP scripts intact so that if oyu go to them directly the header and footer are there Thanks in advance,html

I am sending AJAX GET requests to a PHP application and would like to cache the request returns for later use Since I am using GET this should be possible because different requests request different URLs e g getHTML php page 2 and getHTML php page 5 What headers do I need to declare in the PHP application to make the clients browser cache the request URL content in a proper way Do I need to declare anything in the Javascript which handles the AJAX request I am using jQuery s ajax function which has a cache parameter How would I handle edits which change the content of e g getHTML php page 2 so that the client doesn t fall back to the cached version Adding another parameter to the GET request e g getHTML php page 2 amp version 2 is not possible because the link to the requested URL is created automatically without any checking which is preferably the way I want it to be How will the browser react when I try to AJAX request a cached request URL Will the AJAX request return success immediately Thanks Willem,jquery

It is the first time I m using SELECT queries without having an input I would like to check a table for duplicates As a result I only need to count the result So I have this SELECT field a field b field c FROM table WHERE a AND b AND c GROUP BY duplicatesHAVING COUNT duplicates gt 1would this check the table for duplicates when the structure is like field a field b field c a b c a b c d e fAnd how can I get the result Would it be just num_rows or do I get an integer as a result back from the query Normally I use num_rows to fetch the result from the query like that query db gt query SELECT result query gt num_rows if result 0 do something There usually should be a difference between num_rows and the result because if I would count by using num_rows it will return 2 because 2 have the condition a AND b AND cso I would think that the query from above would return 1 as a result for 1 duplicate found Or am I wrong Thanks alot,database
