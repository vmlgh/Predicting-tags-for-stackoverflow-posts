This is a difficult and open ended question I know but I thought I d throw it to the floor and see if anyone had any interesting suggestions I have developed a code generator that takes our python interface to our C code generated via SWIG and generates code needed to expose this as WebServices When I developed this code I did it using TDD but I ve found my tests to be brittle as hell Because each test essentially wanted to verify that for a given bit of input code which happens to be a C header I d get a given bit of outputted code I wrote a small engine that reads test definitions from XML input files and generates test cases from these expectations The problem is I dread going in to modify the code at all That and the fact that the unit tests themselves are a complex and b brittle So I m trying to think of alternative approaches to this problem and it strikes me I m perhaps tackling it the wrong way Maybe I need to focus more on the outcome IE does the code I generate actually run and do what I want it to rather than does the code look the way I want it to Has anyone got any experiences of something similar to this they would care to share,python

This is a nasty one for me I m a PHP guy working in Java on a JSP project I know how to do what I m attempting through too much code and a complete lack of finesse I d prefer to do it RIGHT Here is the situation I m writing a small display to show customers what days they can water their lawns based on their watering group ABCDE and what time of year it is Our seasons look like this Summer 5 1 to 8 31 Spring 3 1 to 4 30 Fall 9 1 to 10 31 Winter 11 1 to 2 28 An example might be If I m in group A here would be my allowed times Winter Mondays only Spring Tues Thurs Sat Summer Any Day Fall Tues Thurs Sat If I was writing this in PHP I would use arrays like this M Monday t Tuesday T Thursday etc schedule A Winter M schedule A Spring tTS schedule A Summer Any schedule A Fall tTS schedule B Winter t I COULD make the days arrays array Tuesday Thursday Saturday etc but it is not necessary for what I m really trying to accomplish I will also need to setup arrays to determine what season I m in seasons Summer start 0501 seasons Summer end 0801 Can anyone suggest a really cool way to do this I will have today s date and the group letter I will need to get out of my function a day M or a series of days tTS Any Thanks folks,php

My C program has a list of files that can be dragged from it and dropped into another program My requirements are that the file be copied to a different directory first So can I be notified of the drop operation so that I can only copy the file if operation succeeds I d rather wait till I know it needs to be copied before actually performing the copy Also is it possible to know what program the drop operation is occurring in Ideally I d like to alter the filepath based on who or what its being dropped The solution to this can be in any NET language or C C with COM,cpp

In a web application I have a page that contains a DIV that has an auto width depending on the width of the browser window I need an auto height for the object The DIV starts about 300px from the top screen and it s height should make it stretch to the bottom of the browser screen I have a max height for the container DIV so there would have to be minimum height for the div I believe I can just restrict that in CSS and use Javascript to handle the resizing of the DIV My javascript isn t nearly as good as it should be Is there an easy script I could write that would do this for me Edit The DIV houses a control that does it s own overflow handling implements its own scroll bar,html

In python one can get a dictionary of all local and global variables in the current scope with the built in functions locals and globals Is there some equivalent way of doing this in javascript For instance I would like to do something like the following var foo function alert foo var bar function alert bar var s foo locals s alerts foo Is this at all possible or should I just be using a local object for the lookup,python

I am looking for a regex that will match a string that starts with one substring and does not end with a certain substring Example Updated to be correct thanks Apocalisp foo lt bar Should match anything that starts with foo and doesn t end with bar I know about the syntax but I can t find anything that will do that for a string instead of single characters I am specifically trying to do this for Java s regex but I ve run into this before so answers for other regex engines would be great too Thanks to Kibbee for verifying that this works in C as well,java

On a PHP based web site I want to send users a download package after they have filled out a short form The site initiated download should be similar to sites like download com which say your download will begin in a moment A couple of possible approaches I know about and browser compatibility based on a quick test 1 Do a window open pointing to the new file FireFox 3 blocks this IE6 blocks this IE7 blocks this 2 Create an iframe pointing to the new file FireFox 3 seems to think this is OK Maybe it s because I already accepted it once IE6 blocks this IE7 blocks this How can I do this so that at least these three browsers will not object Bonus is there a method that doesn t require browser conditional statements I believe that download com employs both methods conditionally but I can t get either one to work Responses and Clarifications Q Why not point the current window to the file A That might work but in this particular case I want to show them some other content while their download starts for example would you like to donate to this project UPDATE I have abandoned this approach See my answer below for reasons,javascript

Ok so there has to be a way to do this no If not I d love some ideas I have two repeaters and an image inside an update panel along with some AJAX dropdowns with link buttons to the left I want to update the data inside the update panel as fast as possible as values are selected from the dropdowns What do you think would be the best way to update the data The repeaters are populated by objects so if I could just filter the objects by some properties I could end up with the correct data No new data from the server is needed Anyone have some ideas,javascript

I m trying to write a web app that records WAV files eg from the user s microphone I know Javascript alone can not do this but I m interested in the least proprietary method to augment my Javascript with My targeted browsers are Firefox for PC and Mac so no ActiveX Please share your experiences with this I gather it can be done with Flash but not as a WAV formated file I gather it can be done with Java but not without code signing Are these the only options dominic mazzoni I d like to record the file as a WAV because because the purpose of the webapp will be to assemble a library of good quality short soundbites I estimate upload will be 50 MB which is well worth it for the quality The app will only be used on our intranet UPDATE There s now an alternate solution thanks to JetPack s upcoming Audio API See https wiki mozilla org Labs Jetpack JEP 18,javascript

Where can I find a guide for integrating JavaScript and JMS Java Messaging Service I would like a best practice or established technology that allows me to directly or indirectly receive messages from a topic and update a site based on the message I was thinking of creating two components a servlet for the Web module and an MDB Message Driven Bean for the EJB module The web client will comsume messages from the JMS topic and the MDB will handle the onMessage Does this sound correct Have you seen any examples Edit I am using ActiveMQ for the JMS,javascript

Does anyone know of a NET library that will process HTML e mails and can be used to trim out the reply chain It needs to be able to accept HTML or text mails and then trim out everything but the actual response removing the trail of messages that are not original content I don t expect it to be able to handle responseswhen they re interleaved into the previous mail responses in line that case can fail We have a home built one based on SgmlReader and a series of XSL transforms but it requires constant maintenance to deal with new e mail clients I d like to find one I can buy Thanks Steve,html

I have a web page that includes a bunch of images Sometimes the image isn t available so a broken image is displayed in the client s browser How do I use jQuery to get the set of images filter it to broken images then replace the src I thought it would be easier to do this with jQuery but it turned out much easier to just use a pure JavaScript solution that is the one provided by Prestaul,jquery

I ve been programming in C C C and a few other languages for many years mainly for Windows and Linux but also embedded platforms Recently started to do some iPhone programming as a side project so I m using Apple platforms for the first time since my Apple II days I m wondering what other developers that are coming to Mac OSX Xcode and iPhone SDK think Here are my impressions so far Mac OSX very confusing I tend to end up with too many open windows and don t know what s where Luckily there s the bird s eye view without it I d be lost With the shell at least there s all the familiar stuff so that helps me a lot Xcode doesn t feel as good as VisualStudio or Eclipse the two environments I m familiar with I think I could get used to it but I m wondering if Apple wouldn t be better off with Eclipse Before I found the setting where all the windows are stuck together I hated it now I can tolerate it iPhone SDK strange indeed I understand Apple s desire to control their environment but in this day and age it just seems a little sleazy and they are missing out on so much by destroying developer goodwill Objective C I ve known about it for years but never even took a look at it The syntax is off putting but I m actually very intrigued by the language I think it s an interesting third leg between C and C both of which I like a lot Is there any chance Obj C will break out of the Mac sandbox due to the uptick in the popularity of Apple technology Curious to read your thoughts Andrew,cpp

I m trying to implement a pop up menu based on a click and hold positioned so that a really slow click will still trigger the default action and with the delay set so that a text selection gesture won t usually trigger the menu What I can t seem to do is cancel the text selection in a way that doesn t prevent text selection in the first place returning false from the event handler or calling this preventDefault prevents the user from selecting at all and the obvious trigger mouseup doesn t doesn t do anything with the selection at all This is in the general context of a page not particular to a textarea or other text field e stopPropogation doesn t cancel text selection I m not looking to prevent text selections but rather to veto them after some short period of time if certain conditions are met,jquery

I d like to line up items approximately like this item1 item2 i3 longitemname i4 longitemname2 anotheritem i5 Basically items of varying length arranged in a table like structure The tricky part is the container for these can vary in size and I d like to fit as many as I can in each row in other words I won t know beforehand how many items fit in a line and if the page is resized the items should re flow themselves to accommodate E g initially 10 items could fit on each line but on resize it could be reduced to 5 I don t think I can use an html table since I don t know the number of columns since I don t know how many will fit on a line I can use css to float them but since they re of varying size they won t line up So far the only thing I can think of is to use javascript to get the size of largest item set the size of all items to that size and float everything left Any better suggestions,jquery

My understanding is that C C produces native code to run on a particular machine architecture Conversely languages like Java and C run on top of a virtual machine which abstracts away the native architecture Logically it would seem impossible for Java or C to match the speed of C because of this intermediate step however I ve been told that the latest compilers hot spot can attain this speed or even exceed it Perhaps this is more of a compiler question than a language question but can anyone explain in plain English how it is possible for one of these virtual machine languages to perform better than a native language,java

I run a browser based game at www darknovagames com Recently I ve been working on reformatting the site with CSS trying to get all of its pages to verify according to the HTML standard I ve been toying with this idea of having the navigation menu on the left AJAX the pages in rather than taking the user to a separate page each time requiring a reload of the title and nav bar which almost never change and I know that if I do so I will probably break the Forward Back buttons in the browser My question I guess is should I go ahead and AJAX the site thus requiring the user to use the sites navigation to play the game or should I leave the site as it currently stands and use standard hyperlinks and things for navigation The reason I ask I guess is that I built a forums system into the site and a lot of times I would want to link say to a particular topic within the forums I m also open to suggestions Is there a standard preferably without traditional frames way to make only the body area of the site reload while still changing the URL so that users can bookmark and forward back etc That could potentially solve my problem as well I m just asking for the best solution here not an answer to a specific question _ Thanks,html

I need help I want to recreate the the update panel postback without using a update panel to do the postback What is the generic method for doing this For example on stackoverflow when you vote up or down on a question it does a postback to update the database and I would bet they didn t use an update panel What do I have I have a table with table data When I click on the td item as a whole column I want to do a update to the database and also update a gridview on the page it self The gridview shows all the currently clicked items in the table because it was updated via our method Please help looking for a good generic method I could use for a lot of async postbacks without update panel Looking for a good tutorial of some sorts Thanks guys Scott,jquery

I know how to draw basic objects using JOGL or LWJGL to connect to OpenGL What I would like is something that can generate some kind of geometry for trees similar to what SpeedTree is famous for Obviously I don t expect the same quality as SpeedTree I want the trees to not look repetitive Speed is not a concern I do not expect to need more than 100 trees on screen at one time Are there free tree drawing libraries available in Java Or sample code or demos Is there anything in other languages which I could port or learn from,cpp

I have an odd problem I m using a documentation generator which generates a lot of output like docs foo php html It s XHTML and thus contains lt xml gt tags at the beginning of file The problem is Apache has somehow decided to run it through the PHP interpreter even though php appears in the middle of the filename and not at the end This in turn triggers a PHP error because it sees lt as the command to start executing PHP code and immediately gets confused by the xml which follows it How do I configure Apache to ONLY execute php files and not php html files The string php html does not appear explicitly anywhere in my Apache config files There is a line AddHandler php5 script php but I don t see how that would also include php html files,html

We ve recently completed phase 1 of a ASP Net website in English and French We went with using resource files to store language specific strings but because the site used ASP Net AJAX and javascript heavily we rigged up a solution to pass the right files through the ASP Net pipeline where we could catch tokens and replace them with the appropriate text pulled from the resource files This is the second project I ve been involved in that had these kinds of challenges the first one stored the text strings in a database and instead of ASP Net AJAX it used the AJAX tools that come with the Prototype library and put all Javascript into aspx files so that the tokens could be replaced on the way out What I m wondering is has anyone else encountered a similar scenario What approach did you take What lessons were learned How did you deal with things like internationalized date formats,javascript

This is probably a very simple question but what is the technical term for this class of language They use an intermediate assembly type language which is sent through the JVM or CLR They both are object oriented and they both depend on an intermediary such as the Java Virtual Machine or the Common Language Runtime to compile into native machine laguage Unlike Asm C C they don t compile directly into native machine language and require intensive memory allocation knowledge They both use garbage collection Is there a technical term which seperates Java and C from C,java

A client of mine is looking to convert a critical application based on multiple very complex spreadsheets into a web app As part of this they d like some of the web pages they use to enter model data to resemble a spreadsheet as much as possible I d be interested to know if anyone has any experience recommendations for embeddable controls that could do this better than standard html javascript ajax code although suggestions for Javascript frameworks that could do this are welcome too I m thinking mainly of ActiveX Flex Java or similar controls commercial or open source are fine The coding languages to be used and platform is still open to debate so ASP NET against IE or PHP Flex against Firefox or some other combination is fine this will be driven by the business requirement not the platform Functionality is of course the main driving force but it s always useful to have nice looking eye candy so skinable and cool is a plus With reference to Javascript frameworks I ve previously used Dojo and Mootools but I d prefer something with a bit more snap,javascript

One of the most difficult problems in my javascript experience has been the correct that is cross browser computing of a iframe height In my applications I have a lot of dynamically generated iframe and I want them all do a sort of autoresize at the end of the load event to adjust their height and width In the case of height computing my best solution is the following with the help of jQuery function getDocumentHeight doc var mdoc doc document if mdoc compatMode CSS1Compat return mdoc body offsetHeight else if browser msie return mdoc body scrollHeight else return Math max mdoc height mdoc body height I searched the internet without success I also tested Yahoo library that has some methods for document and viewport dimensions but it s not satisfactory My solution works decently but sometimes it calculates a taller height I ve studied and tested tons of properties regarding document height in Firefox IE Safari documentElement clientHeight documentElement offsetHeight documentElement scrollHeight body offsetHeight body scrollHeight Also jQuery doesn t have a coherent behavior in various browser with the calls document body height html doc height window height I call the above function not only at the end of load event but also in the case of dynamically inserted DOM elements or elements hidden or shown This is a case that sometimes breaks the code that works only in the load event Does someone have a real cross browser at least Firefox IE Safari solution Some tips or hints,jquery

Most of the documentation available for building Python extension modules uses distutils but I would like to achieve this by using the appropriate python autoconf amp automake macros instead I d like to know if there is an open source project out there that does exactly this Most of the ones I ve found end up relying on a setup py file Using that approach works but unfortunately ends up rebuilding the entire source tree any time I make a modification to the module source files,python

Without using a WebBrowser control how could I execute a JavaScript function that is decoupled from any browser DOM dependencies in a C application I am investigating implementing validation rules only once for both server and client validation See this question for reference if you like Are there any JS interpretor libraries I could use Addendum My goal here is to automatically deploy and invoke exactly the same validation logic on client and server without communication between the two during the actual validation So ideally I would code my validation logic in JavaScript and render that to the page Alternatively I could code my logic in C convert that to JavaScript using Script and render that to the page I don t want separate validation functions being maintained client and server side and I don t want AJAX calls to server validation functions and I don t want client only or server only validation,javascript

I have a VS 2005 C project that uses a special Plugin folder to load extra DLLs for use as nodes in an asset conversion process I have a mixture of C and C DLLs in this folder The issue I have is that when Shadow Copying is enabled the C DLLs refuse to load using Assembly LoadFrom I have attempted to create a custom app domain and used Load but this also failed Finally I tried reading the DLL in as byte data and using Load on that again only the C DLLs would work this way with an error Additional information Unverifiable code failed policy check Exception from HRESULT 0x80131402 An article on the net prompted me to attempt to use clr safe when building that particular DLL but then it simply failed to build due to thousands of errors in Microsoft code apparently With Shadow Copying disabled LoadFrom works fine for all DLLs The app is itself a plugin for Maya and this used to work with Maya 8 5 but fails with 2008 2009 if Shadow Copying is enabled We really would prefer to use Shadow Copying because it prevents DLL file locks when the app is running the Plugins folder is stored in a location that Perforce can update while the app is running Any ideas as to how I can persuade Shadow Copying to work with a custom folder AND a mix of C C DLLs without these problems,cpp

I m trying to implement a stateful web service in PHP using the SOAP extension Yes I know that web services are supposed to be stateless all I really care to persist is some form of a session ID so I don t need to authenticate with every call to the service PHP net s API documentation is somewhat lacking on this and there isn t much else written on it I found one page that discusses it http bytes com forum thread160816 html and implemented the code as a test I built a small NET application that consumes the web service and calls each function and displays the result From what I ve read the PHP SOAP extension will persist class variables between calls as long as the functionality is encapsulated in a class using the setClass function and the setPersistence function is passed SOAP_PERSISTENCE_SESSION Here is my code lt php class User var name Initial value function setName name this gt name name Tried this too this gt name Set to string constant function getName This always returns Initial value return this gt name Tried placing session_start in several places before server gt handle One guy says this doesn t need to be called I assume it depends on if session autostart is on session_start server new SoapServer null array uri gt http localhost server gt setClass User server gt setPersistence SOAP_PERSISTENCE_SESSION server gt handle gt The problem I run into is that name is not persisted between calls I always get the initialized value and not the value I assign to setName As I stated I m trying to persist a session ID after authenticating against a database if anyone has a better way to do this I m open to suggestions however I would still like to solve the general case Anyone have any ideas,php

We re looking into transport protocol solutions and were about to do various performance tests so I thought I d check with the community if they ve already done this Has anyone done server performance tests for simple echo services as well as serialization deserialization for various messages sizes comparing EJB3 Thrift and Protocol Buffers on Linux Primarily languages will be Java C C Python and PHP Update I m still very interested in this if anyone has done any further benchmarks please let me know Also very interesting benchmark showing compressed JSON performing similar better than Thrift Protocol Buffers so I m throwing JSON into this question as well,python

We have some integer arithmetic which for historical reasons has to work the same on PHP as it does in a few statically typed languages Since we last upgraded PHP the behavior for overflowing integers has changed Basically we are using following formula function f x1 x2 x3 x4 return x1 x2 x3 x4 However even with conversions function f x1 x2 x3 x4 return intval intval intval x1 x2 x3 x4 I am still ending up with the completely wrong number For example with x1 1580033017 x2 2072974554 x3 1170476976 and x4 1007518822 I end up with 30512150 in PHP and 1617621783 in C Just adding together x1 and x2 I cannot get the right answer In C I get 1580033017 2072974554 641959725 In PHP intval intval 1580033017 intval 2072974554 2147483648 which is the same as intval 1580033017 2072974554 2147483648 I don t mind writing a IntegerOverflowAdd function or something but I can t quite figure out how 1580033017 2072974554 equals 641959725 I do recognize that it is 2147483648 2 2 31 but 2147483648 2 31 is 1505523923 which is greater than Int Min so why is do you add 2 2 31 and not 2 31 Any help would be appreciated,php

I m developing an editing component iframe based in JQuery My intention is to make it easy to extend the functionality of the editor through plug ins So for example you might make a plug in that puts wavy underlines underneath spelling mistakes or allows images to be inserted etc I m happy to work out the technicalities of this myself but I m finding it difficult to decide how to architect the API The editor itself is currently a plug in You instantiate it through code such as the following id_of_a_div editComponent Does JQuery allow you to have plug ins inside plug ins Or is there some better way of achieving this,jquery

I have a method which will accept a parameter of a JQuery Object and will calculate totals for a section So if you give it a JQuery Object of a div containing the section it will calculate a total for it so you can do this var totalcompletion CalculateSectionCompletion jQuery Section1 Now I have multiple divs with the class of section container I want to be able to call the above method on any div with that class I m doing this jQuery div SectionContainer each function i valueOfElement CalculateSectionCompletion valueOfElement The problem is the valueOfElement is actually the DOM object and not the JQuery Object so I can t pass this in to my method Is there anyway I can loop through all JQuery Objects selected by a query without writing some dirty code to extract the Id from the DOM object and call JQuery valueOfElement id and pass it in,jquery

I am not trying to make this a preference question I am really wondering what people s experiences are with using jQuery and Rails or jRails for development Most rails users including myself up to now have been using Prototype However I am mixing in a lot of jQuery plugins since they are so easy to use and extend I am now thinking about moving from Prototype to jQuery for a new Rails project However I love the Power of Prototype Protoype is almost a new language that sites ontop of JS whereas I find that jQuery is like a great scripting language with lots of syntax sugar and chaining Anyway your thoughts would be much appreciated,jquery

I have the following RegEx id id The reason for this is I am trying to replace Ids from the browsers DOM using JavaScript IE however strips quotes from element atributes as it appears not to require them in the DOM The problem I have is that the backrefererences from each alternate statement are in separate groups 1 and 2 as the match is only one OR the other can I return both the backreference as a single backreference EDIT lt div id test1 gt lt div id test2 gt will match as follows match 1 2 id test1 test1 id test2 test2 I just want both backreferences to be added to 1,html

Any idea how to render a PDF using iTextSharp so that it renders the page using CSS The css can either be embedded in the HTML or passed in separately I don t really care just want it to work Specific code examples would be greatly appreciated Also I would really like to stick with iTextSharp though if you do have suggestions for something else it s got to be free open source and have a license that permits using it in commercial software,html

I asked about getting iTextSharp to render a PDF from HTML and a CSS sheet before here but it seems like that may not be possible So I guess I will have to try something else Is there an open source NET C library out there that can take HTML and CSS as input and render it correctly I must reiterate the library MUST be free and preferably something with a fairly liberal license I m working with basically no budget here,html

Well I ve been given an assignment to basically figure out how memory allocation works for whatever language I ll be using After some research I have some questions and doubts which I d like to get some insight in For example I read here that Java specifies exactly how the stack contents are organized Looking at the JVM spec structure it basically says the stack contains frames and that the frames contain whatever is inside the class by properly allocating the variables and functions Maybe I am missing something here but I don t understand how this is any different than what C does I ask because the first link says Java s specification of stack contents avoid compiler incompatibilities Also I have yet to find how the memory segments are exactly organized on top of each other For example I know the memory is divided into global variables call stack heap and code for C yet I don t know if the heap s address is higher than the stack s or if that depends on the implementation I also wonder whether a Java program has more than that and how it would be laid out as well I imagine there is a standard since the JVM has to know where it all is to use it though I suppose it could just have the pointers and leave the rest to the OS I imagine too that there must be at least a de facto standard Another the thing I don t understand is the runtime constant pool It s supposed to be a per class or per interface runtime representation of the constant_pool table in a class file but I don t think I understand what it does It seems to have a tag to indicate what type the structure in question is Then the name of the structure given by the programmer or assigned by the underlying system Then it seems the rest of it varies with whatever the tag describes a thread an array etc If my interpretation of the runtime constant pool is right then why are they necessary as well as stack frames Is it because stack frames only take care of the stack segments and the runtime constant pool must also have pointers for the heap allocated memory,cpp

First off I know this is probably a tall order but We have some software that interacts with the hardware our company produces This software loads a NET assembly and this acts as our interface to the hardware Currently we have a Launcher application written in C which provides role based security This Launcher launches the C executable with command line arguments the NET assembly to use via a process The C executable then loads the supplied NET assembly and uses it to perform its actions The problem is because I launch the C application in a process I lose the role based security context provided by the Launcher Is there any way I can launch the C application and keep the role based security context Thanks for taking the time to read this If you have any questions please let me know Thank you Adam,cpp

As a mostly self taught programmer I have never really had anyone explain why certain things should or should not be used One example which I picked up years ago and use quite often is the alternative control structure syntax x y true foo bar I personally find this syntax easy to follow especially for short concise code but I don t see it get a lot of use in the wild so I d like to know if it s bad practice to use this over a more traditional if else structure Thanks in advance,php

I m debugging someone else s code for a web page that is made with ASP NET with some javascript effects It s a form that we are pre populating with edit able data and one of the text boxes is getting populated with an incorrect value I know that the text box is getting filled with the correct value in the code behind but somewhere between there and the browser it gets overwritten In trying to find out where that happened I came across an interesting situation If I right click near the offending element and select view page source I can scroll down to the element and see lt input name RecurrenceProperties TextBox57 type text value HEY ITS THE RIGHT VALUE id RecurrenceProperties_TextBox57 gt But the wrong value is in both the rendered html and the IE developer toolbar This seems like a hell of a clue but I don t know enough about how View Source works to tell what is going on behind the curtain What happens between the generation of the View Source source and the page actually rendering EDIT I found where it was going wrong by putting a break point on everywhere that ID occurs in javascript not exactly elegant but I found it Suggestions to disable javascript and use IE8 were very helpful thanks,html

I am building a site that is an interface used to create XML files that are read as input by a server side program The website allows users to dynamically create blocks of HTML Each block can be thought of as an object and contains several input fields When the user submits the form the data is turned into an XML file What is the best way to preserve rebuild the user generated HTML across the post request I am using JQuery but not AJAX,jquery

Has anyone not noticed that JQuery uses ActiveX controls When a user has limited their activex security they will get script prompt popups and a yellow bar accross the top of their browser window This setting is by default on Windows Servers Internet Cafe s dont support Active X Company internal workstations dont support this Considering this I don t see how people can use JQuery in a commercial application Do you use JQuery in a commercial application Does this concern you Do you think I should be concerned with this,jquery

JSON allows you to retrieve data in multiple formats from an AJAX call For example get sourceUrl data callBack json could be used to get and parse JSON code from sourceUrl JSON is the simply JavaScript code used to describe data This could be evaled by a JavaScript interpreter to get a data structure back It s generally a bad idea to evaluate code from remote sources I know the JSON spec doesn t specifically allow for function declarations but there s no reason you couldn t include one in code and have an unsafe and naive consumer compile execute the code How does jQuery handle the parsing Does it evaluate this code What safeguards are in place to stop someone from hacking sourceUrl and distributing malicious code,jquery

I have a java applet running in a browser that is calling some javascript functions and expecting a result from theses functions This is working with the following configurations Internet Explorer FireFox Windows Safari Mac BUT It s not working with Firefox on MAC OS The source of the problem seems to be the win eval calls that always return null I tested this with Firefox 3 0 6 on a Mac OS X 10 4 11 A bit of code JSObject win JSObject JSObject getWindow this Object exp win eval testfunc System out println exp exp toString This triggers a java lang NullPointerException exp toString statement The testfunc javascript function just returns true I tried with win call and got the same result My applet tag includes the mayscript and scriptable attributes I found the answer thanks to Tristan Testing his solution I created a really simple test that could work and worked my way to find the culprit I was sure I did my tests with an empty testfunc that just returned true but I probably didn t because in that case it DOES work The real problem here was that the function called a public method of the applet Liveconnect doesn t seem to be able to handle that case in Firefox Mac Let me give you an example Java class public class MyApplet extends Applet public int getMyValue return 5 public void somefunction JSObject win JSObject JSObject getWindow this Object exp win eval jsfunc System out println exp exp toString And the javascript code function jsfunc var myApplet document getElementById applet_id return myApplet getMyValue 5 exp will be null in somefunction BECAUSE jsfunc calls the getMyValue method of the applet If you remove all calls to properties of the applet you re cool To solve my problem I decided to give all the values of the applet that I neeeded as parameters of my javascript function and I m good now That may not be the case always if the javascript changes the state of the applet I was lucky,javascript

I need to debug a web application that uses jQuery to do some fairly complex and messy DOM manipulation At one point some of the events that were bound to particular elements are not fired and simply stop working If I had a capability to edit the application source I would drill down and add a bunch of Firebug console log statements and comment uncomment pieces of code to try to pinpoint the problem But let s assume I cannot edit the application code and need to work entirely in Firefox using Firebug or similar tools Firebug is very good at letting me navigate and manipulate the DOM So far though I have not been able to figure out how to do event debugging with Firebug Specifically I just want to see a list of event handlers bound to a particular element at a given time using Firebug JavaScript breakpoints to trace the changes But either Firebug does not have the capability to see bound events or I m too dumb to find it Any recommendations or ideas Ideally I would just like to see and edit events bound to elements similarly to how I can edit DOM today,jquery

I have been working on a project that dynamically creates a javascript file using ASP NET which is called from another site This jquery javascript file appends a div and fills it with a rather large HTML segment and in order to do that I need to turn the segment into a string like so document ready function var html Giving this magazine such a lofty epithet may seem a bit presumptuous but for a non scientifically trained outsider this magazine offers a fresh and challenging look at the fast paced world of science that doesn t shy away from humor and the use of terms and ideas that may require its readers to go online and define a term And in some cases it may inspire the reader to pick up a book on science by such greats as Hawking and Greene in order to better grasp some of the concepts dealing with time space and atoms This magazine isn t dumbed down It includes well placed and efficient illustrations to help explain some of the more abstract points It is not designed in the way popular magazinea are in so much as they only touch upon a topic in the simplest manner and then move on before the audience is lost Yet this magazine keeps the attention of the reader by combining explanatory notes that help people with no background knowledge have some grasp of the topic and by using humor and well written articles to clearly make their points lt br gt For a magazine with a serious and well researched list of topics having small cartoons the likes of the New Yorker shows how comfortable this magazine is with itself From the moment I picked up this magazine for the first time I felt like every word I read mattered and was worth my time to read Not true of many other magazines American Scientist may not have the audience of Discover or National Geographic nor is it as accessible as said titles but for those with a true interest in science willing to challenge themselves and commit to real learning this magazine may be a perfect fit At 4 95 it is certainly worth it to pick a copy on the news stand and try it out divname append html As you can see the segment will be pretty large and I have no way of knowing how big as it is generated dynamically from my database depending on the reviewID which is defined by the user in their request The html to be inserted into the div is a list of reviews and is generated using asp net MVC by a repeater which loops through a list if that helps give you an idea of what I am doing Is there any way to turn this large segment into one string which can be inserted into the append script Thank You,jquery

Let s say I ve got a DOM element how can I tell whether it matches a jQuery selector such as p or myclass It s easy to use the selector to match children of the element but I want a true false answer to whether this particular element match The element may not have an ID and I can t assign it a random one for reasons beyond this so I can t apply my selector to the element s parent and look for children with the same ID as mine Will this work as intended I can t figure out Javascript object comparisons selector myElement parentNode each if this myElement Found it Seems like there would be an easy way to see whether a DOM element matches a jQuery selector,jquery

I have some ANSI standard C code which is authoritative What that means is that although I have the source I can not translate to another language nor modify calling arguments as those actions would invalidate the authority There are over 150 functions I can make incidental changes such as change the file names from C to CPP so that it compiles using Visual Studio 2009 s C compiler which I have done Compiler directives and such can also be added I can also go through a wrapper layer if necessary Another restriction is my company does not want me to use the unsafe key word in any C code I need to get at these functions from a C program A typical C C function looks like this double SomeFunction double a double 3 vec double 3 3 mat Where the array contents are sometimes input sometimes output and rarely both I first tried making an unmanaged DLL with the functions marked Extern C Functions with only simple arguments int double worked fine but I could not determine how to Marshal the arrays Actually I did find some sample code but it was extremely complex and unreasonable to duplicate 150 times I then tried two projects within the same solution one in C and the other in C In the C project I created a managed function which just called the original function which was marked as unmanaged This was extremely clean and simple and again simple arguments worked fine But for arrays I couldn t find how to make the argument types match across the C to C boundary Argument 2 cannot convert from double to double and as mentioned above I can t use unsafe to get a pointer Certainly what I am trying to do must be possible What is the best way to get at these functions Sample code using the above function would be really cool,cpp

I need to automatically generate a PDF file from an exisiting X HTML document The input files reports use a rather simple table based layout so support for really fancy JavaScript CSS stuff is probably not needed As I am used to working in Java a solution that can easily be used in a java project is preferable It only needs to work on windows systems though One way to do it that is feasable but does not produce good quality output at least out of the box is using CSS2XSLFO and Apache FOP to create the PDF files The problem I encountered was that while CSS attributes are converted nicely the table layout is pretty messed up with text flowing out of the table cell I also took a quick look at Jrex a Java API for using the Gecko rendering engine Is there maybe a way to grab the rendered page from the internet explorer rendering engine and send it to a PDF Printer tool automatically I have no experience in OLE programming in windows so I have no clue what s possible and what is not Do you have an idea EDIT The FlyingSaucer iText thing looks very promising I will try to go with that Thanks for all the answers,html

What do you guys recommend for a UI library to use with jQuery jQuery UI seems to have less widgets compared to other frameworks I ve been playing around lately with the Dojo Toolkit which seems pretty nice so far and I know that there is always the Yahoo User Interface but is there anything else I also need to consider licensing something that can be distributed with Open Source software licensed under the BSD license as well as internal use software,jquery

I want to select the first row in a table order by time ascending then delete that row I don t want to use two queries since there s a possibility that another client could select that row before it gets deleted there will be several machines connected at once from different networks I was thinking I could do something likeSELECT FROM mytable ORDER BY time LIMIT 1 DELETE FROM mytable ORDER BY time LIMIT 1 but I got an error You have an error in your SQL syntax check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near DELETE FROM pending ORDER BY time LIMIT 1 at line 1What s the best way to do this Thanks,mysql

It is the first time I m using SELECT queries without having an input I would like to check a table for duplicates As a result I only need to count the result So I have this SELECT field a field b field c FROM table WHERE a AND b AND c GROUP BY duplicatesHAVING COUNT duplicates gt 1would this check the table for duplicates when the structure is like field a field b field c a b c a b c d e fAnd how can I get the result Would it be just num_rows or do I get an integer as a result back from the query Normally I use num_rows to fetch the result from the query like that query db gt query SELECT result query gt num_rows if result 0 do something There usually should be a difference between num_rows and the result because if I would count by using num_rows it will return 2 because 2 have the condition a AND b AND cso I would think that the query from above would return 1 as a result for 1 duplicate found Or am I wrong Thanks alot,mysql
