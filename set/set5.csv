I ve decided to convert a Windows Phone 7 app that fetches an XML feed and then parses it to an asp net web app using Visual Web Developer Express I figure since the code already works for WP7 it should be a matter of mostly copying and pasting it for the C code behind HttpWebRequest request HttpWebRequest CreateHttp http webservices nextbus com service publicXMLFeed command routeConfig amp a sf muni amp r line1 That s the first line of code from my WP7 app that fetches the XML feed but I can t even get HttpWebRequest to work in Visual Web Developer like that Intellisense shows a create and createdefault but no CreateHttp like there was in Windows Phone 7 I just need to figure out how to fetch the page I assume the parsing will be the same as on my phone app Any help Thanks Amanda,phone

Does anyone know a good play plugin that automatically minifies javascript and css to attach to a production play server I ve found this one but I guess there are more out there https github com greenlaw110 play greenscriptThe main problem I see here is that the having javascript being generated from the play side the plugin would have to detect JS code that gets generated on the fly Mainly because I m writing values directly into the javascript like function foo handlerID someVar var x some_val var t foo handlerID bar,minify

My question is similar to this ASP NET MVC 4 Minification amp Background ImagesExcept that I want to stick with MVC s own bundling if I can I m having a brain crash trying to figure out what the correct pattern is for specifying style bundles such that standalone css and image sets such as jQuery UI work I have a typical MVC site structure with Content css which contains my base CSS such as styles css Within that css folder I also have subfolders such as jquery ui which contains its CSS file plus an images folder Image paths in the jQuery UI CSS are relative to that folder and I don t want to mess with them As I understand it when I specify a StyleBundle I need to specify a virtual path which does not also match a real content path because assuming I m ignoring routes to Content IIS would then try to resolve that path as a physical file So I m specifying bundles Add new StyleBundle Content styles jquery ui Include Content css jquery ui css rendered using Styles Render Content styles jquery ui I can see the request going out to http localhost MySite Content styles jquery ui v nL_6HPFtzoqrts9nwrtjq0VQFYnhMjY5EopXsK8cxmg1This is returning the correct minified CSS response But then the browser sends a request for a relatively linked image as http localhost MySite Content styles images ui bg_highlight soft_100_eeeeee_1x100 pngWhich is a 404 I understand that the last part of my URL jquery ui is an extensionless URL a handler for my bundle so I can see why the relative request for the image is simply styles images So my question is what is the correct way of handling this situation,net

In python I have the following graph graph 1 graph 2 graph 3 graph 1 3 graph 3 graph 2 1 graph 1 graph 2 3 graph 3 graph 3 2 graph 2 this is a structure to represent a graph and that I find nice because its structure is the same as the one of one of it s nodes so I can use it directly to initiate a search as in depth first The printed version of it is 1 3 2 1 3 2 1 3 2 3 2 3 2 1 3 3 And it can be used like graph 1 3 2 3 2 1 3 2 1 3 2 keys Now I m curious to know how would one implement it in C C and Java without resorting to Object tricks that would fill the code with ugly casts For C I was thinking in templatemeta programming but that would generate finite data types when what is needed is something likemap lt int map lt int gt gt or map lt int gt,strong
I ve successfully created and installed a loadable kernel module for my development phone Does anyone know how to make a status bar notification to the user i e Notification NotificationManager from the kernel I understand how to create a service and use Notification NotificationManager to generate a status bar notification But how do you make a notification when the event is in the kernel I m having a problem bridging the gap A similar functionality I m trying to achieve is like connecting to the phone via USB When the phone detects a USB connection a status bar notification is produced and if debugging is enabled it will tell you that too How is this done At some point the kernel sends a signal but how is the notification generated The approach I m going to try and implement is using the NDK Create a library that listens waits for a signal from my LKM then use then create an app that s just a background service that notifies when the signal is received Is there a more elegant solution for this And I d like to not have to recompile the AOSP Thanks,source

Iâ m using the a service layer with a ModelStateWrapper as shown here Whatâ s he proper way to control the error keys to use when validating in the service layer so they correspond to the input names in my views e g I have the following ViewModel for a customer public class CustomerViewModel public string Name get set â And the following ViewModel for some use caseâ s View the user can create two customers on the fly in this use case by entering their names public class SomeOtherUseCaseViewModel public CustomerViewModel BuyingCustomer get set public CustomerViewModel SellingCustomer get set â Which I use in the View like this lt â gt lt Html EditorFor model gt model BuyingCustomer Name gt lt Html ValidationMessageFor model gt model BuyingCustomer Name gt lt â gt lt Html EditorFor model gt model SellingCustomer Name gt lt Html ValidationMessageFor model gt model SellingCustomer Name gt In my customer service Iâ ve the following validation method which gets called when creating the customer note that this is a different Customer class this is a domain class public bool ValidateCustomer Customer customer Check if there is another customer with the same name if â _validationDictionary addError â Nameâ â There is another customer with the same nameâ the _validationDictionary holds the ModelStateWrapper return false Do you see my problem Depending on the View the error should be added with the key â BuyingCustomer Nameâ or â SellingCustomer Nameâ or eventually there will be two errors one with each key instead of just â Nameâ otherwise the framework wonâ t properly highlight the fields and show the errors What is the proper way to solve this situation neatly I don t want to pass the error key prefix to the service layer because that s a UI concern and not a service layer concern right,modelstate

I m trying to wrap my head around this task and wondering if there is a standard way of doing this or some libraries that would be useful Certain events are tracked and timed at several data sources S1 SN The recorded information is the event type and timestamp There may be several events of the same type sequentially or they may be intermittent There could be missing events i e when one of the sources misses it and vice versa when a source introduces a false positive There is typically a time difference between observations of the same event at different sources This time difference has a constant component due to physical location of the sources but may also have a varying component introduced by network latency and other factors I need to find an algorithm that would find the optimal maximum time interval that should be used to group the observations at all sources in a single observed event and allow detection of the missing events and false positives I am wondering if the solution is really somewhere in the statistics field rather than algoritghms Any input would be much appreciated,difference

I m trying to use the Yodlee soap APIs They give examples with Apache AxisAny perspectives on using Ruby and Savon versus Java and Axis With Ruby Savon it seems that the best thing to do is to skip using the WSDL files and generate the requests based on examples from the Java Axis program I tried using the WSDL feature of Savon but I could not get it to work with the many embedded types and namespaces in the very complex WSDLs Looking at the Java Axis code there s a huge amount of generated code that isolates the Java developer from knowing about the XML Has anybody ever tried to replicate Axis in the Ruby world Thanks,savon

I m currently receiving weird segmentation violations when runnning a MATLAB MEX file in parallel After a lot of debugging I m 99 sure that the segmentation violation has nothing to do with the MEX file itself but with the fact that I m running it in parallel One possible reason for the segmentation violations that was suggested is that the C library functions malloc and free may not be thread safe Is this really a possibility And is there any way that I can make sure I compiled the MEX file using the GNU C 2 14 90 development C Library so I guess I m looking for a website where this is distributed these types of questions are answered,mex

The SetupI have an OpenVPN server that acts as a central router It is configured with topology subnet command Clients are Debian Linux nodes and each have one or more subnets directly connected to them The objective is for any client connected to the VPN to be able to access the subnets connected behind each other client In order to spread the routing information we have installed Quagga on the clients and on the server This works fine using the OSPF daemon Routing is enabled on all the clients and the server as well Routing tableThe routing table on the server is the following Kernel IP routing tableDestination Gateway Genmask Flags Metric Ref Use Iface10 2 10 1 10 8 0 4 255 255 255 255 UGH 20 0 0 tun0192 168 100 0 10 8 0 4 255 255 255 0 UG 20 0 0 tun0192 168 1 0 10 8 0 4 255 255 255 0 UG 20 0 0 tun0The subnet I want to access is 192 168 100 0 24 The gateway in question responds perfectly fine and I can connect to it alright I don t think this will be of any use but here is part of the client routing table 10 2 10 1 0 0 0 0 255 255 255 255 UH 0 0 0 tun0192 168 100 0 0 0 0 0 255 255 255 0 U 0 0 0 eth1192 168 1 0 0 0 0 0 255 255 255 0 U 0 0 0 eth0Where things start going southPinging from the server 10 8 0 1 to any hosts including the VPN client interface in the 192 168 100 0 24 subnet fails If I tcpdump the tun interface on the VPN client I see no relevant package If I tcpdump the tun interface on the VPN server I see the package in question being sent out The real edgy thing is that when I traceroute to a valid IP in the 192 168 100 0 subnet it doesn t discover any hops there should be just one If I traceroute directly to the next hop 10 8 0 4 it responds fine I really hope I am being clear as this is quite a complex problem I ll be happy to provide extra information at your request,quagga

I m building an estimate for a potential client I ll do some more research if I get the project but need some ideas for now I m trying to figure out a good solution that won t take several months to develop but will still provide good flexibility for future enhancements My options I believe are cms e commerce plugin e g drupal ubercart e commerce platform that is extendable e g magento framework e commerce platform e g ci magento cms e commerce e g wordpress magento The site will be similar to etsy where users can have items that they sell with their own portfolio page The client wants to add many custom features as well Also the site will serve up a lot of images and audio I m concerned that using strictly a e commerce platform will give me a lot of obstacles to overcome rather than use just a cart framework I know Magento is written on Zend but while I have used Magento I m not very familiar with Zend and it seems to take quite a while to learn I have never used ubercart wp e commerce or virtuemart so I m not sure of the limitations The products will not need to be configurable But we will need to store financial information I m thinking braintree s vault or authorize net cim I d like to do the framework ecommerce platform route But the client would also like a lower price option I m leaning towards drupal ubercart Just would like some opinions from personal experience Thanks,ubercart

I m currently reading Advanced Programming in the Unix Environment by Stevens Rago Within the process group section of the book the author discusses how process groups are utilized commonly by shells for pipelining For example the argument shown below could have been generated by shell commands of the form proc1 proc2 amp proc3 proc4 proc5Lots of other resources also discuss the relationship between process groups and pipelining However the one thing which I cannot find is an explanation of how the pipelining portion of this is implemented I know that in Linux shells like Boune again shell BASH processes in a pipeline are executed in parallel that is in the previous example showing proc3 proc4 proc5 all three of these processes are simultaneously executed The stdin of proc4 is connected to the stdin of proc3 I also know that MS DOS used temporary files and did not execute pipes in parallel but let s ignore that for the moment So I ve got proc3 proc4 proc5 all in a process group Fantastic How does this actually help with creating the pipelines between them As far as I can tell I need to do the following to enable pipelining in a shell which I build Create N 1 pipelines where N is the number of processes in thepipelined statement fork the shell process N timesIn each forked process I need to use dup2 to properly set up theshared pipelinesThen after all of the forked processes have confirmation that theyhave all finalized setting up their pipes likely via some IPC via ashared memory space each can then run exec and actually launchtheir respective processes However all of the texts which I keep reading act as if process groups provide some magical functionality to create these pipelines or they are simply neglecting to mention the procedure I outlined above Any comments or advice is always appreciated,operating

I have specified the Action method to use for the Async request with Url Action but unlike with specifying the ajax options for a form and storing them i e AjaxOptions ajaxOpts new AjaxOptions UpdateTargetId tabledata Url Url Action AppointmentData And than just passing this ajaxOpts into the Ajax BeginForm I am unable to store the ajax options in a variable and than pass that into Ajax ActionLink Please see the syntax I am attempting below Ajax ActionLink cat CATNAME ajaxOpts new CatID cat CATID count Model Count AjaxOptions ajaxOpts new AjaxOptions UpdateTargetId catlist Model Count Url Url Action GetCats Whilst something like the below without trying to use graceful degradation works fine of course but with jscript turned off it just emits the partialview without the rest of the page Ajax ActionLink cat CATNAME GetCats new CatID cat CATID count Model Count new AjaxOptions UpdateTargetId catlist Model Count It s understandable that when you don t specify the URL for the form and instead just use AjaxOptions as a parameter and jscript is turned off the form will just by default post back to the Action that rendered the page But is something similar possible for the ActionLink,net

Sorry if it is a duplicate as I am not a security nor network expert I may have missed the correct lingo to find information I am working on an application to intercept and modify HTTP requests and responses between a web browser and a web server see how to intercept and modify HTTP responses on server side for the background I decided to implement a reverse proxy in ASP Net which forwards client requests to the back end HTTP server translates links and headers from the response to the properly proxified URL and sends the response to the client after having extracted relevant information from the response It is working as expected except for the authentication part the web server uses NTLM authentication by default and just forwarding requests and responses through the reverse proxy does not allow the user to be authenticated on the remote application Both the reverse proxy and the web application are on the same physical machine and are executed in the same IIS server Windows server 2008 IIS 7 if that matters I tried both enabling and disabling authentication on the reverse proxy app with no luck I have looked for information about it and it seems to be related to the double hop problem which I do not understand My question is is there a way to authenticate the user on the remote application through the reverse proxy using NTLM If there is none are there alternative authentication methods I could use Even if you don t have a solution to my problem just pointing me to relevant information about it to help me get out of the confusion would be great,proxy

Now this may sound like my earlier problem question but I ve changed and tried a few things that were answered in my other questions to try to make it work but I ve still got the same problem I am observing a core data property from within a NSManagedObject sub class and the method that gets called when the property changes calls another method but in this method it adds Core Data objects which triggers the KVO method which triggers the method again and so forth Or so it seems I m not too sure about that because something different seems to happen here is the series of events â I click a button syncing with iCal this in an IBAction with the exact same code thats in the method syncKVO This sync works fine I add an object to my outline view All is well I change its name which triggers the KVO Declaration because I changed the name property which syncs with iCal Works fine I delete the object I just added and somehow it triggers the KVO declaration thus triggering the method and puts me into an infinite loop Now for some code Code inside the NSManagedObject Subclass called JGManagedObject â void awakeFromFetch self addObserver NSApp delegate forKeyPath name options 0 context

I m trying to see if it is possible to put some text over an image without using position absolute or having the image being the background of an element The reason for the constraints is that the HTML code is going into an e mail and it turns out that hotmail supports neither I remember that when I first began studying CSS fiddling around with float ing text around images I often ended up with the text merrily going all over the image Sadly I can t reproduce that behavior Full story edited in I received a fancy layout from the graphics designer It s basically a nice background picture with logos linking to websites and what basically is a text goes here area in the middle As usual in these cases I m using tables to make sure that everything stays in place AND works crossbrowser crossmailclient The problem arises from the fact that the middle text goes here area is not a white rectangle but has a some background graphics Having made some test it appears that Live Hotmail does not seem to like neither position absolute or background image relative margins are also not good because they d ruin the rest of the layout Current version works in any other mail client website lt td gt lt img src myimage jpg width 600 height 400 alt gt lt p style position absolute top 120px width 500px padding left 30px gt blablabla lt br gt yadda yadda lt br gt lt p gt lt td gt Of course â it s not possibleâ could be a perfectly acceptable answer but I hope not,absolute

I ve been using EF for a while now always in the Model First approach Now I m adventuring through Code First lands The thing is I ve been having issues with automatic table creation According to some sites it is possible And I ve tried their approach with no success Here s one of the things I ve tried Database CreateIfNotExists No luck My connection string is perfect and working If I add the table manually it does work The problem is when I don t have the table created It just doesn t create as I was said it would My classes are correctly decorated Again It s working when I have the DBs created Any suggestions Does this feature really works I m using Visual Studio 2010 Professional EntityFramework 4 3 1 although I tried with 4 1 also SQL Server 2008 R2Thanks in advance,ef

I have a process that exports the results of a database call to a CSV file The data types and file format must match a specific format so the file can be uploaded to an external system This process has been running for maybe 7 or 8 years on an ASP NET NET 2 0 webform and suddenly sometime over the last 6 18 months it s not working the way it used to Perhaps after NET 4 0 was installed on the client server or maybe after some other framework update or windows update or provider update Our DLL has not changed in a few years I d like to fix this legacy process with the least amount of hacking and slashing possible There are three data types being exported integer string and decimal The problem is that all the integer columns are being exported as decimals now The CSV export library looks at the datatypes of the columns to determine the correct output format so I use a XSD file to define my DataSet before filling it Here is a simplified example of the XSD file lt xml version 1 0 standalone yes gt lt xs schema id FDSR xmlns xmlns xs http www w3 org 2001 XMLSchema xmlns msdata urn schemas microsoft com xml msdata gt lt xs element name FDSR msdata IsDataSet true msdata Locale en CA gt lt xs complexType gt lt xs choice maxOccurs unbounded gt lt xs element name TBLEXPORT gt lt xs complexType gt lt xs sequence gt lt xs element name INTCOLUMN1 type xs integer minOccurs 0 gt lt xs element name STRCOLUMN2 type xs string minOccurs 0 gt lt xs element name DBLCOLUMN3 type xs decimal minOccurs 0 gt lt xs sequence gt lt xs complexType gt lt xs element gt lt xs choice gt lt xs complexType gt lt xs element gt lt xs schema gt The data types defined for each column used to persist after the data was loaded but now they are reset by the data load For example Dim ds as New DataSetds ReadXmlSchema MyFile xsd Breakpoint here ds Tables 0 Columns 0 DataType shows Name Int64 FullName System Int64 Dim db as New DatabaseCall my db call ds db ReturnData Breakpoint here ds Tables 0 Columns 0 DataType now shows Name Decimal FullName System Decimal GenerateCSVOutput ds How can I force the integer column to remain an integer after the database call Or how can I change the datatype after populating the dataset This code has been simplified for posting but basically the db ReturnData is calling an Oracle stored procedure to do some processing and return the data using System Data OracleClient OracleDataAdapter Fill dataset to populate the DataSet There is no integer column in Oracle so the source table has the column defined as NUMBER 1 0 It s definitely outputting the correct precision I just don t understand why the column type in the DataSet is suddenly changing when it is explicitly defined as an integer Unfortunately the CSV file needs to be uploaded to an external government system that will not accept 1 0 for 1,net
Coming from question SQL Server 2008 connection tagged under sql server 2008 express Chris S wrote in SQL Server 2008 R2 vs SQL Server 2008 R2 Express The biggest different I see others have missed is that Express does not accept network connections only local ones I am having difficulties to find reference where is it written Can you give me one What are network connections only local ones on the same network in the same AD inside the same developing machine Can they be from the same workgroup Windows computer,2008
I m trying to create a float texture to store intermediate results of my rendering pipeline created by a fragment shader I need the values of the fragments to be signed floats I understand that there is the OES_texture_float extension which should be supported by all new iOS devices i e beginning from iPhone 3GS iPod Touch 3 iPad according to the Apple guide However when I create such a texture usingglTexImage2D GL_TEXTURE_2D 0 GL_RGB width height 0 GL_RGB GL_HALF_FLOAT_OES NULL start my app and inspect it in Instruments it tells me glTexImage2D GL_TEXTURE_2D 0 GL_RGB width height 0 GL_RGB GL_HALF_FLOAT_OES NULL invalid enum 0x8d61 Invalid enum for argument type The curious thing is that it s nevertheless working on my iPhone 4S but not on a iPhone 4 which should be supported as well The error message appears for both devices though But on the iPhone 4 OpenGL can t build a valid framebuffer object using this texture as a rendering target On the 4S that works perfectly well Do you have any suggestions what I m doing wrong Thanks,point
The title sounds rediculous because it is My biggest issue is actually trying to figure out what question to ask The goal To be able to implement the code as described below OR to figure out what terminology I should be using to search for the correct answer The issue I wish to have a system where classes register processors via a method within the class definition eg class RunTheseMethodsWhenICallProcess Include ProcessRunner add_processor a_method_to_run add_processor another_method_to_run def a_method_to_run puts This method ran end def another_method_to_run puts another method ran endendModule ProcessRunner def process processors each meth self send meth endendMy issues are mostly with understanding the scope and reference of the class to make them interact As it stands I have been able to add a static method add_processor by calling class extend AClass in the included method and adding in the class there The idea for this syntax was inspired by DataMappers property and before methods Even with the code checked out I am having a touch of trouble following it Thanks so much for any help you can offer,include

I ve been designing an application that requires the use of a scrollbar on a custom view The problem that I have run into is that my custom view s height will constantly change when new items are added by the user I suspect that this isn t a very unusual problem but to complicate things I m not actually adding new objects to my custom view I m just drawing Bitmap images on the canvas The reason this is troublesome to me is when Android inflates the layout it sets the size to be whatever I tell it 0dip and as I add the Bitmaps it simply changes the size to fill the Scrollview thereby whenever the Custom View draws an image beyond the current height constraints instead of scrolling the app simply cuts the picture off to maintain the current height This is for a card game app so I wanted to fan out your current deck in a easy to view and edit fashion Here is the relevant code public class DeckEdit extends Activity implements FilterQueryProvider static final int PROGRESS_DIALOG

I have a property on a model that accepts a string value and stores hex values for colorseg EEEEEE 000000I integrated a jquery plugin so that the user can use a color picker I like it since it s very easy to use The problem is that when you pick a color it fills up the text box with a character which then makes it easy to change the color of the textbox for User friendliness purposes it s part of the plugin Now I want to save the value on post but the problem is the validation on the model will only accept the following characters 0 9A F Which I also want to maintain no special characters on the database So I figured to avoid the validation I would modify the textbox on click of the button My questions are 1 Is that the most efficient way 2 If it is how would i do it using jquery or something else Let me know your thoughts Thanks,3

This is a theoretical question I ve already got a solution to my problem that took me down a different path but I think the question is still potentially interesting Can I pass object properties as delegates in the same way I can with methods For instance Let s say I ve got a data reader loaded up with data and each field s value needs to be passed into properties of differing types having been checked for DBNull If attempting to get a single field I might write something like if rdr field1 Equals DBNull Value myClass Property1 rdr field1 But if I ve got say 100 fields that becomes unwieldy very quickly There s a couple of ways that a call to do this might look nice myClass Property GetDefaultOrValue lt string gt rdr field1 Which incidentally is the route I tookWhich might also look nice as an extension method myClass Property rdr field1 GetDefaultOrValue lt string gt Or SetPropertyFromDbValue lt string gt myClass Property1 rdr field1 Which is the one that I m interested in on this theoretical levelIn the second instance the property would need to be passed as a delegate in order to set it So the question is in two parts Is this possible What would that look like As this is only theoretical answers in VB or C are equally acceptable to me Edit There s some slick answers here Thanks all,csharp

Can it really be true that the attr href command for a link is handled very different in IE7 in comparison to all other browsers Let s say I have a page at http example com page html and I have this HTML lt a href someAnchor class lnkTest gt Link text lt a gt and this jQuery var strHref lnkTest attr href Then in IE7 the value of the strHref variable will be http example com page htm someAnchor but in other browsers it will be someAnchor I believe that the last mentioned case is the most correct one so is it just a case of IE7 being a bad boy or is it a bug in jQuery,relative

I am new to both DBs and Rails using 3 2 and I suspect this is a basic question that I m just having trouble finding an answer for I m making an app that tracks articles people submit to journals So each user has a number of articles For each article they can submit it to a number of journals The submission object itself keeps track not only of the article being submitted and the journal it s submitted to but also the date it was submitted the way it was submitted email online system etc the date a response was received if any the response if any e g accepted resubmit decline I m trying to allow a user to view all of their outstanding submissions in one place So for each user I m trying to query the db to get all submissions belonging to articles that belong to that user but only returning the submissions for which response is NULL meaning there is no response yet and thus the submission is still outstanding So my models are related like this class User lt ActiveRecord Base has_many articlesendclass Article lt ActiveRecord Base belongs_to user has_many submissionsendclass Journal lt ActiveRecord Base has_many submissionsendclass Submission lt ActiveRecord Base belongs_to article has_one journalendNow for a given user I think I could do something like articles_with_subs user articles joins submissions and then out_subs Array new articles_with_subs each do article outs article submissions where response NOT NULL out_subs push outsend out_subs flatten but that seems pretty inefficient What probably big obvious thing am I missing Thanks very much,rails
My question is closely related to this previous post which was quite helpful but I still can t get it working right Php MySql Query with Multiple Keyword for Multiple FieldsI have lt 10 000 rows might grow to 20k max of data in a SQL table titled table with for example three fields FIELD1 varchar FIELD2 text FIELD3 year4 note real data includes about 10 to 15 fields and may change CURRENTLY CODE FUNCTIONS AS FOLLOWS The following code below which I got by following a few youtube tutotorials allows me to search all three fields with one keyword e g dog If I type in two words into my search box e g dog sled then one of the three fields must contain the exact phrase dog sled for any results to be returned at all So if one field has both sled and dog but not in that order the record will not be returned lt php Initialize the search output variable See if the posted search field is set and has a valueif isset _POST searchquery amp amp _POST searchquery Filter the search query user input searchquery preg_replace a z 0 9 i _POST searchquery sqlCommand SELECT FROM table WHERE FIELD1 LIKE searchquery OR FIELD2 LIKE searchquery OR FIELD3 LIKE searchquery connect to localhost database search stuff and print out the results query mysql_query sqlCommand or die mysql_error count mysql_num_rows query if count gt 1 search_output lt hr gt count results for lt strong gt searchquery lt br gt lt br gt while row mysql_fetch_array query field1 row FIELD1 field2 row FIELD2 field3 row FIELD3 search_output field1 field2 field3 lt br gt lt br gt lt br gt else search_output lt hr gt 0 results for lt strong gt searchquery lt br gt lt br gt Whoops try another search gt IDEAL FUNCTIONING I would like to be able to type a few words into the search box and have the query look for each search word across all three fields Additionally I would like results with more matching words to be ranked weighted higher e g a search with words dog sled 2005 would give a higher rank to a query that found all three words somewhere across the three fields and give less weight to a query that found only two or one of the words Finally since my database is growing I would like to truncate the results so only 50 results are displayed for any search Thanks in advance TimUPDATE I ve addressed some early questions I got on this issue below 1 What are some examples of real world data that can be found in field1 field2 field3 Would it be individual words or entire phrases sentences paragraphs The real world data is about 15 fields including numbers words phrases abbreviations lists of words and even paragraphs They are for something like a library catalog of books and reports and less formal papers and documents Some fields and examples follow Year e g 2010 Season e g fall First_name e g William Last_Name e g McShane note would be great to accomodate appostrophes but not necessary e g O reilly can t Smith Jenkins Title e g The economic decline of blah blah regions Description e g this text addresses a wide range of issues on Classification e g 4AB51 45 Phone e g 555 121 5444 Email e g jkr ppp cometc 2 In the design you re looking for does keyword order still matter For instance if field1 I ate a souffle made from lobster and I search for lobster souffle should it work I m not so concerned with word order or even phrases There will likely never be more than 20 000 records in the entire database and at the moment there are only a few thousand so really a search for just two key words across fields would likely be enough to narrow most searches down to a dozen results With one key word though it is impossible there might be 1000 records with 2010 as the year so I can t even search by year without getting a flood of results The query just needs to find entries with all or some of the words with higher weight given to records that contain more of the keywords Most of the keyword searches will look for words often in different fields so i might type 2010 economic airlines Florida taxes and hope to get records for a about 5 reports written in 2010 that dealt with the effects of taxation on the airline industry that were maybe published by authors in Florida or maybe Florida showed up in another field e g a Florida based airline etc Sorry for the long winded response So to answer the original question If you search for lobster Souffle is should find a record with a Field1 entry of I ate a souffle made from lobster Similary if field one contains lobster and field2 contain souffle it should find the record and weight it equally since it found two of the search words And now two design questions 3 Will you ever add a field4 field5 field6 and so on in the future The reason I m asking is that you may want to consider abstracting your search keywords into a separate search table or something like that It s not normalised if you re not familiar with the term normalisation means designing your database so that no piece of data will ever be in two places but it does make things much more efficient I can explain that a little more later if you want I will almost certainly add remove fields in the future I don t know what normalization is 4 I see you re stripping out all characters that aren t alphanumeric or the space will you want to be able to deal with apostrophes like wasn t or O Ryan hyphens and so forth As mentioned above it would be great to deal with apostrophes and hyphens I only have the bit in there that strips those out because that is the way it was done for the example on YouTube that I got the idea from I don t think any search phrases will include words like isn t but might include authors with appostrophes like O reilly or hyphens like Smith Galviston And there will be middle initials too like George P Scott,weighted
I m working my way through the MVC Storefront code and trying to follow the path of a repository a service and a model that is a poco outside of the dbml data context It s pretty easy to follow actually until I started writing tests and things failed in a way I just don t understand In my case the primary key is a uniqueidentifier instead of an int field The repository returns an IQueryable public IQueryable lt Restaurant gt All return from r in _context Restaurants select new Restaurant r Id Name r Name In this case Restaurant is a Models Restaurant of course and not _context Restaurants Restaurant Filtering in the service class or in repository unit tests against All this works just as expected var results Repository All Where r gt r Name BW lt 3 ToList This works just fine has one Model Restaurant Now if I try the same things with the pkid var results Repository All Where r gt r Id new Guid 088ec7f4 63e8 4e3a 902f fc6240df0a4b ToList If fails with The member BurningPlate Models Restaurant Id has no supported translation to SQL If seen some similiar posts where people say it s because r r Id is Model Restaurants is a class level the linq2sql layer isn t aware of To me that means the the first version shouldn t work either Of course if my pk is an int it works just fine What s really going on here Lord knows it s not very intuitive to have one work and one not work What am I misunderstanding,iqueryable
Another question for my EclipseLink and Spring MVC and spring data version 3 1 1 set up I m trying to get JPA working without the use of the persistence xml file in accordance with this article In the article it says Usually JPA defines a persistence unit through the META INF persistence xml file Starting with Spring 3 1 this XML file is no longer necessary â the LocalContainerEntityManagerFactoryBean now supports a â packagesToScanâ property where the packages to scan for Entity classes can be specified The persistence xml file was the last piece of XML to be removed â now JPA can be fully set up with no XML I understand that if one were making use of the persistence xml file all Entity classes here should be declared here However I m trying to make use of the packagesToScan property instead Below is the full startup log and the error produced after making one request to the servlet which ultimately attempts to create a new user in the database It doesn t seem to recognise that the User object is an Entity Since I have little experience with Spring I was wondering if anyone firstly can spot a mistake I m making but otherwise knows the best way to debug this I want to know what Entity objects have been recognised by the EntityManagerFactory My backup option is to switch to using persistence xml haven t tried it yet actually but I d like to be rid of that if possible one less XML file to worry about UPDATE I ve updated the error log after making the recommended config change to the entityManagerFactory based on the answer by Sean Patrick Floyd but that did not solve the main issue What I have also done is tried an alternative way of getting this to work by creating a persistence xml file the old and more common way of doing this and added a small piece of test code within the servlet I access to kick off this functionality So now I have this bit of code in my servlet User user new User user setFirstName John user setLastName Doe user userService addUser user EntityManagerFactory emf Persistence createEntityManagerFactory proxiPU EntityManager em emf createEntityManager em getTransaction begin em persist user em getTransaction

I ve created my dataset and tableadapters using Stored Procedures from a SQL database When coding the application I have a variety datagridviews that populate when the user opens a particular record most are sub sets of data My problem arises during the save routine Because I am using SPs my usual update line is something like this Me tbaSOMEDATASOURCE UPDATE FIELD1 FIELD2 FIELD3 FIELD4 etc While I could run the update on the row validated event in the dgv I d rather hold all updates until the user selects the SAVE button This could result in a number of row updates in any one DGV Should I be looking to add a IsUpdated column to each DGV then cycle back through and update each row by itself or is there an easier way Thanks,2010
After four weeks of learning Objective C for the iPhone my first useful application is almost finished However I still need to save several instance variables whenever the current view is changed and to reload them when the view is reopened I have no trouble loading variables with basic C types like int and BOOL but am having difficulty with a linked list made of Objective C objects The linked list consists of memory accessed by three pointers startPointer currPointer and endPointer Each element consists of a last pointer a next pointer a pointer to a nested linked list nestedPtr and some variables My first attempt was to do the following in the loading code dataStorageObj will contain the values to be loadeddataStorageObj DataSaver alloc init NSData data NSMutableData alloc initWithContentsOfFile documentsDirectory stringByAppendingPathComponent Archive NSKeyedUnarchiver unarchiver NSKeyedUnarchiver alloc initForReadingWithData data dataStorageObj unarchiver decodeObjectForKey KeyForViewA unarchiver finishDecoding Simple variables loaded here DataSaver is a class with methods to retrieve its instance variables The methods are named after the values they retrievestartPointer dataStorageObj startPointer currPointer dataStorageObj currPointer endPointer dataStorageObj endPointer unarchiver release data release I placed a debug point at the end and all of the variables had the correct values Actually accessing the values in the code doing so in the console worked resulted in EXC_BAD_ACCESS messages Next I changed the linked list loading lines to the following startPointer PointerClass alloc initPointerFromList dataStorageObj startPointer currPointer PointerClass alloc initPointerFromList dataStorageObj currPointer endPointer PointerClass alloc initPointerFromList dataStorageObj endPointer The initPointerFromList method PointerClass initPointerFromList PointerClass theList last theList last nestedPointer NestedPointerClass alloc initNestedPointerFromList theList nestedPointer Other variables loaded from theList here if theList next nil next PointerClass alloc initPointerFromList theList next return self The problem now was that the pointers were all pointing to individual linked lists so I wrote methods to retrieve the start and end locations of the linked list referred to by currPointer currPointer PointerClass alloc initPointerFromList dataStorageObj currPointer endPointer currPointer lastElement startPointer currPointer firstElement My question is threefold Is it necessary to use methods such as initPointerFromList to allocate memory for a loaded linked list Is there a more efficient way to maintain the relationship between currPointer endPointer and startPointer than by searching through the list using the lastElement and firstElement methods Is there something wrong with the techniques behind the loading code I have presented Without it I have no problems with it I still get BAD_ACCESS messages I want to know if these messages are tied to the loading code or if to the way I have handled object allocation throughout the rest of my application Thanks in advance,allocation

Is it possible to specify an origin at the top left 0 0 for scaling and a different origin center for rotation in CSS3 I am only working with webkit if that helps I am currently using a transform list i e webkit transform scale newScale rotate newRotate but it seems like it isn t possible to change the origin in between passes Is there a better way to look at this Presently if I scale an object and rotate it with an origin at the default center the position of the element is now off and so when you drag the element the cursor is still at the top left of the element whereas it should be at the center Changing the origin to the center to scale it fixes this but presents new problems with rotation and flipping,css

I have a Vizio Notebook CN15 A5 It came pre installed with Windows 8 x64 and is taking advantage of UEFI out of the box The BIOS APTOS AMI is in Secure Boot mode with the OS selected as Windows 8 I removed the stock HDD that came with the machine and put my own SSD into it I created a Windows 8 Pro x64 installation disc on a 4GB USB flash drive formated as FAT32 since its apparently required for UEFI When I boot from the USB Win8 installation disc I get suck when I reach the Custom Install Windows only section Normally you would see a list of available discs and their partitions however my entire list is blank If I head back to the BIOS and disable Secure Boot and set the OS to Other OS and attempt again I am able to see the list of available discs in the system and can install a copy of Windows 8 Unfortunately doing it in this method results in an installation with a traditional 350 MB partition OS partition instead of 4 partitions which is normal for a UEFI setup Has anyone run into this problem I ve tried loading defaults in the BIOS and attempting to install via every combination with no luck Any help would be appreciated,uefi

It seems interesting that nobody asked this before I have some basic questions about the configuration of CXF Clients We have a Tomcat running our application This application needs to communicate with a WebService The implementation of the client is done with CXF and this implementation is packaged in a JAR File Lets say ws client jar It is possible and desirable that there are other implementations of clients for other webservices also using CXF And each WS Client should be packaged in its own JAR File So at the end I ll have our application WAR containing all other ws client jar I need bigApplication war WEB INF lib ws client jar WEB INF lib ws client2 jar WEB INF lib ws client3 jar WEB INF classes classAnd now the question Where can may I put the cxf xml Can I put a configuration file in each ws jar Can a put in addition another in the war file Or only one cxf xml file must exist Which path in the archive is the best By now I just copy a configuration file in tomcat webapps bigApplication WEB INF classes cxf xml probably also not the best place for it The problem is I need to do that every time I deploy the application And I want actually only to configure ws client jar and not all CXF WS Clients So I want to configure things as specific as possible and in the write place Any answer is welcome also Links to the right information which I didn t find UPDATE As it is a somehow long question here the questions in the post together Can I put a cxf xml file in a jar archive Can more than one cxf xml file exists per application One in each relevant jar file Where is the best path in a jar file to put the cxf xml UPDATE,war

You are allowed to roll a die up to six times Anytime you stop you get the dollar amount of the face value of your last roll Question What is the best strategy According to my calculation for the strategy 6 5 5 4 4 the expected value is 142 27 approx 5 26 which I consider quite high So this might be the best strategy Here 6 5 5 4 4 means in the first roll you stop only when you get a 6 if you did not get a 6 in the first roll then in the second roll you stop only when you roll a number 5 or higher i e 5 or 6 etc,dice

Suppose I created a standalone application in java and distributed it through my website What I need to know is what is the ideal Database solution I can use so that all the users can use the application without installing anything extra For example if I use SQL server or MySql database the downloader will need those installed so that I can dump my database on it Another solution I see is to use Database file like Microsoft Access mdb file But that too will need Microsoft Office installed on the client XML files are platform independent but anyone can open and change them What is the solution used by most of the applications,dbms

I have an ASP NET app running on a webserver A third party is created another app in PHP which needs to send data to my app for processing Initially it was assumed that the PHP app would be deployed elsewhere so we agreed that the communication would occur over the internet via HTTP over SSL My app would simply use a generic handler ashx file to recieve the data and send confirmation back Now it seems that the PHP app might be deployed on the same machine as my app I like the fact that using HTTP as opposed to say direct database access the PHP app needs to know nothing at all about how my app works But using the public internet seems silly for communication between two apps on the same machine If the PHP app simply used a localhost address would this ensure that all the data stays within the machine Is there a better way to do this,communication
I have a Windows Server with 2 Ethernet ports both with 1GB cards and I have 20 users connecting to the server to run an application which involves a lot of data being transferred and the speeds are really slow even though we have 2x 24 port gigabyte switches I was just wondering what could be causing the slow speeds and would it run better if I only used one Ethernet port on the server or could it be the switches Would linking 2 ports from each switch together improve performance at all The server has a 6 core 3 3GHz processor and 8GB of RAM,r2

I ve recently been watching some screencasts in order to get a feel for the javascript programmer perspective and coding process and have been a little frustrated especially coming from a ruby background seeing all of this stuff done by hand and with such odd naming conventions So there is CoffeeScript which I m looking at with a fair amount of interest Then there is RJS but then Rails 3 has pulled support for that and I don t want to learn an outdated method Then there is Go which I m not sure has enough support yet and just don t know enough about yet Then of course all along here most of the time here there s jquery But should I even use jquery Can I get around writing javascript entirely Would could the circumvention attempt be fruitful I m not asking for a therapy session or a bashing session so if you re wound up like that please don t post here I m actually intrigued by javascript If only because all of the cool programmers are talking about functional languages now But I don t want to waste my time And all I really need to have is a robust way for passing information from rails active record to the javascript in a variety of ways And I need to know what I m doing with javascript In fact that s mainly all I need to do I need to be able to look at javascript or coffeescript or go or whatever and see it like I see ruby which looks like an orchestra if it s written right So my questions are these a It seems like a lot of javascript tutorials are produced by javascript programmers who don t know what exactly it is they are doing What are some good tutorials that involve a developer going over code thinking aloud CORRECTLY about Javascript Also rails javascript materials Sorely lacking There is not a single book out on Rails 3 Javascript which is crazy because so much has changed since 2006 s Ajax on Rails What resources do you know of other than lots of time b RJS Coffeescript etc v Javascript Jquery or alt What are the weaknesses of using the higher level abstracted languages and what are the benefits And most importantly for me a rails user what is the solution that is most likely to be compatible with rails 2 years from now RJS sounded like a great idea But it used prototype right Is there an RJS which is Rails 3 ready And again guys the book issue Seriously this is a nice little opportunity for a knowledgable rails javascript developer Nothing has been released by the major publishers explicitly on Rails and Javascript since 2006 That is just astonishing,ruby

I have heard people state that method swizzling is a dangerous practice Even the name swizzling sugests that it is a bit of a cheat MethodSwizzling is modifying the mapping so that calling selector A will actually invoke implementation B One use of this is to extend behavior of closed source classes Can we formalise the risks so that anyone who is deciding whether to use swizzling can make an informed decision whether it is worth it for what they are trying to do E g Naming Collisions If the class later entends its functionality to include the method name that you have added it will cause a huge manor of problems Reduce the risk by sensibly naming swizzled methods,swizzling

Define the Revision Tracking Graph RTG which is an oriented graph without circles where each node x has a set C x associated with it C x contains all edges on all paths from a node 0 C 0 Each edge can be in a set at most once You can also describe this data structure by the rules for its growth Start with node 0 with associated empty set C 0 creating new objectFor any node x create a new node y where x y is oriented edge from x to y and C y C x union x y versioning and branchingFor any nodes f and t create node r where f r and t r are oriented edges and C r C f union C t union f r t r mergingNote You can see there is no mathematical difference between creating new version and a branch It is a semantical difference depending on whether there is already an edge leading from the node or not Base node is defined as a node b such as C b C f intersect C t where f and t are nodes representing two versions to be merged Simple Merge equation Result To From Base means that if we subtract every edge in C b from C f and add all edges in C t we get a resulting C r minus f r and t r edges exactly No edge would appear twice and all edges in C f and C t would be represented 3 way mergeComplex merge equation Result To Sum i 1 n for Fi Bi where Fn From Each edge can be in exactly one of the sets To Fi Bi For n 1 this turns into a simple merge equation In case there exist no base in simple case we might find sequence of F B nodes to fit the complex equation 1 2n way mergeI have actually several questions pertaining to this data structure I am posing the first 3 for frame of mind as I already know the answers And I believe question 4 directly leads to answering question 5 which I really try to get answered Prove there can be no circles in the graph Prove that for certain graphs there are such nodes F T for which base cannot be found as specified in simple equation Create algorithm to find B in simple case where n 1 Prove that for each RTG and each pair of nodes F and T there is a set of n pairs of nodes Fi Bi where i 1 n to fit the complex merge equation Create algorithm to find minimum n and Fi Bi for i 1 n where n 1,graph
Is it possible to pass the pointer to an object in a drag and drop operation Here is the scenario I have an NSArray of custom objects For arguments sake we ll say this is a list of person objects The list is tied to an NSTableView via an NSArrayController The NSTableView is a drag source and I have an NSView as a drag destination When implementing drag and drop I can easily get the name of the currently selected person s from the NSArrayController as an NSString in the drag process and pass it to the receiver in the NSView However I would like to be able to pass a pointer to the person object so the receiver has access to the entire object The problem seems to be that the drag operation creates a new instance of a person object and does not make a reference to the selected person object despite implementing the required methods in the person model As a result I get a person object at the destination it just isn t populated with the data from the object I ideally I want the object pointer because the NSView will make use of the object reference in order that any updates to the object itself are reflected in both the NSView and the NSTableView and everywhere else the object is used Is it even possible to use the object reference in a drag and drop operation or do I need to pass some custom reference that is an iVar of the person object and then do a lookup once it arrives at the destination This would seem a little archaic to me considering how much object referencing Obj c has I understand that a target could accept a drag operation from outside the application but specifying the operation as a local operation would account for this would it not I ve checked the apple docs but still don t seem to be able to find an answer Drag and Drop Programming TopicsPasteboard Programming GuideAny and all help much appreciated,and

I am implementing full text search in postgres I would like to search all posts in my system The posts fulltext index is an amalgamation of the post title and post body I have two ways of achieving this create a tsvector column in the posts table trigger an update to it create a second table posts_search with a post_id and tsvector column containing the index data create a simple gin index out of the question cause my real world problem needs data in multiple tables for the index What is going to perform better considering I sometimes need to filter down the search by other attributes in the table like deleted_at is null and so on Is it a better approach to keep the tsvector column in the same table as the data side effect select now sucks or a separate table side effect join required index filtering is complicated,search

In my company we have high employee turnover and hence our helpdesk receives about a dozen requests per week for new Active Directory accounts Currently we receive these requests simply via e mail or voice mail and rarely do we have all of the information necessary to create the account I would like to find a web application that can be used by a manager or supervisor to formalize the requests they make for AD accounts for new employees under their command Ideally the application would prompt for all of necessary information and allow the helpdesk to review the requests and approve or deny each one If approved the application would take care of creating the account and send an e mail to the manager I have found several application on the Internet that handle self service account management i e password resets or update contact info which is also nice to have but nothing that streamlines the new account request and creation part Can anyone make suggestions on such an application Thanks,accounts

When selecting from an XmlDocument by e g the XPath method SelectSingleNode we get an XmlNode that consist of the first matching node lets call it lt node1 gt If we do further selection on lt node1 gt then one might expect that the XPath root now is this node but this is incorrect the root is still the same as in the original XmlDocument Here s an example XmlDocument xd new XmlDocument xd LoadXml lt root gt lt subroot gt lt elm gt test1 lt elm gt lt elm gt test2 lt elm gt lt elm gt test3 lt elm gt lt subroot gt lt root gt XmlNode xnSubRoot xd SelectSingleNode root subroot This is the XPath I want to be able to use but it returns null XmlNode xnElm xnSubRoot SelectSingleNode subroot elm This works but the XPath root is the same as in the original document xnElm xnSubRoot SelectSingleNode root subroot elm Is there any way to fix the root of xnSubRoot so that I can use the XPath I want The reason for my question is because I have a case where I m calling a webservice that returns an XmlNode where the OuterXml property shows a structure of Data SubElement and so on but when running XPath Data then null is returned only SubElement works i e the XPath root seems to be one level lower than the actual document root I m sure there is a perfectly reasonable explanation for this or that I m missing something vital However I really can t seem to find anything even though I ve read http msdn microsoft com en us library d271ytdx VS 80 aspx N B I do realize that it would be possible to use the XPath subroot elm but then I might also get other elements further down in the XML structure,0
I have a Class API that uses an IQueryable lt FirstClass gt data source however I wish to expose an IQueryable lt SecondClass gt where SecondClass is a wrapper class for FirstClass that exposes nearly identical properties however for various reasons needs to inherit from an unrelated base class For example My APIvoid IQueryable lt SecondClass gt GetCurrentRecords return from row in dataSource Linq query select new SecondClass row User of my APIvar results GetCurrentRecords Where row gt row Owner Mike Now I can make the above compile simply by using AsQueryable however I want to expose a true IQueryable that efficiently queries the database based on the API users query I know that this isn t trivial my wrapper IQueryable implementation needs to understand the relationship between the properties of SecondClass and FirstClass and that it has nothing to do with the Select function but it seems like it should be possible How do I do this Note I know that instead my API could just expose FirstClass along with a helper method to convert FirstClass to SecondClass for when the API user is done creating their query but it feels messy and I don t like the idea of exposing my generated classes in this way Also I d like to know how to do the above anyway just from a purely academic standpoint,to

There is a directed graph having a single designated node called root from which all other nodes are reachable Each terminal node no outgoing edges takes an string value Intermediate nodes have one or more outgoing edges but no value associated with them Edges connecting a node to its neighbor have a string label The labels for edges emanating from a single node are unique There could be possible cycles in the graph What is the best graph algorithm for checking if two such directed possibly having cycles graphs as described above are equal,graph
I like security as a hobby and I not so often I read and play with a few simple KeyGen games and I enjoy it Reversing and KeyGen is very interesting but I m a beginner and my questions are probably very dumb but I will be very thankful if you could help me Until the moment I have reversed simple keygen applications using techniques such as Look for string text reference to find the interesting code area Keygen fishing And bypass IsDebugPresent check Yeah I know really basic stuff Here is a video similar to what I do in generalâ http www youtube com watch v tJY_Tv7o5bEJust for learning sometimes I try to reverse a few small and medium application that I buy for Windows and looks like simple products without many protections This is a software that I acquired 2 months ago and the whole installation is around 50MB One of the motivations to try apply my basic knowledge here is because I like to see if what I learned in keygens really work in real life my experience that medium softwares are much harder since keygens are very small and easy to find the routines that you want Just to keep it very clear I have a license for this program and my intention is only learn and increase my knowledge Since I have no commercial intention in break it or create any damage I will not disclosure the application I hope you understand OK let s go The application consist of one main executable 33MB 6 DLLs very small ones and some of them are libeay32 dll etc and around 90 xsd files XML format My first step was try to identify the programming language used and if a packer was present please see screenshots below http img11 imageshack us img11 3982 01exeinfodetection pnghttp img11 imageshack us img11 812 02rdgdetector pngIt really appears to be developed in Delphi with CFF I confirmed it Also there is no section that points for an packer looking at CFF information and EXE Information and RDG also say it s clean However RDG found IsDebugPresent and pointed for an protection software as you may see However I m not sure if it s a false positive On my application the serial is entered in a field like that http img850 imageshack us img850 5889 03wheretoinsertserial pngAnd once I enter a wrong serial number 30 chars long I get a message like that http img534 imageshack us img534 2687 04custommessagebox pngI guess it s not a MessageBox or at

also tried to set breakpoints in Names from User32 dll such as GetDlgItemTextA and GetDlgItemTextW since I believe they are the APIs used to read my entered serial number The strange thing is that they are exported and not imported as demonstrated below Is it normal http img822 imageshack us img822 6456 14settingbreakpointatge pngOnce I created the breakpoint and stated stepping into I got this

There are many tutorials online giving very complex or non working examples on this It seems that people recommend others to use the syntax highlighters offered by netbeans but I am totally puzzled on how to do so I have checked many many sites on this and the best I can find is http www antonioshome net kitchen netbeans nbms standalone phpHowever I am still not able to use this example as it is aimed to people who don t want to use the Netbeans platform but just a portion of it and I am still not sure if I can just use syntax highlighting in a simple plug n play way For example netbeans supportsseveral language highlights by default can I just use the highlighters in a JEditorPane to parse Ruby Python Java for example or do I need to write my own parser I will really appreciate a small simple example on how to plug syntax highlight in a standalone application using the netbeans platform,jeditorpane

I m planning a system for serving image files from a server cluster with load balancing I m battling with the architechture and whether to save the actual image files as blobs in the database or in filesystem My problem is that the database connection is required anyways as the users need to be authenticated Different users have access only to contents of their friends and items uploaded by themselves Since the connection is required anyways maybe the images could be retrieved from there aswell Images should be stored with no single point of failure And obviously the system should be fast For database approach The database is separate from rest of my application so my applications main database won t get bloated by all the images Database would be easy to scale as I just need to add more servers to the cluster Problem is that I ve heard this might be a slow system from a website with millions even billions of photos For filesystem I would be really interested in knowing how could one design a system where the webservers are load balanced and none of them is too important for the overall system All the servers should use a common storage so they can access the same files in the cluster What do you think Which is the best solution in this case What kind of overall architechture and servers would you recommend for a image serving cluster Note This cluster only serves images Applications servers are a whole different story,computing

I am experimenting with dependent types Lets assume the following short notation px A B The product type A gt B The product type when x does not occur in BNow according to the generalized type system a triple s1 s2 s3 regulatesthe formation of product types We have the following formation rule G A s1 D x A B s2 p rule G D px A B s3In the examples I have seen the sorts are always atomic Would it be possibleto have a dependent sorts s2 The question came up when I tried to model the formation rule as a dependenttype itself My idea was that px A B is a shorthand for a lambda expressionwhere p is some predefined constant px A B p A lx A B The following p s work 1 p of type py o y o o it does the same as the triple o o o and thus says thatif a is a proposition and b is a proposition then a b isalso a proposition implication This is how it works p py o y gt o gt o a o a o a o p a a gt o gt o a gt a a gt o p a a gt a o1 p of type py i y o o it does the same as the triple i o o and thus says thatif x from some set A and B x is a proposition then px A B x is a proposition forall quantifier This is how it works assuming q nat o p py i y gt o gt o nat i x nat q x o p nat nat gt o gt o lx nat q x nat gt o p nat lx nat q x oBut I don t see how it should work when s2 is dependent That s2 isdependent would mean that we have D x A B s2 x Have some logical systems where s2 is dependent already been studied What would be the formation rule I guess we cannot go along with p py s1 y s2 x s3 because x has not the right scope Any ideas Bye H P Barendregt Introduction to generalized type systems Journal of Functional Programming 1 2 125 154 April 1991,theory

The third normal form of database design asks you to remove functional dependencies It seeks to eliminate redundancy removing from a table any attributes fields that can be calculated from the other fields For instance when you make a reference to another entity you only store its key You don t store replicas of attributes from these referred entities because that would mean having to update them every time you change the referred entity Another situation is an attribute such as height You want to know the height of a person but in your application you may like to know it in different units meters feet astronomical units But you don t store all of these values you should remove calculated fields so you only leave one of them meters of course and you calculate the transformed values on the fly when you need it You also don t store something like age you calculate them from date of birth In this case the fact that age changes with time also plays a role If you don t do this your data will soon be incorrect unless you keep updating it constantly Now suppose you have a social network that displays the astrological sign of each user For each user we display his or her sign which is calculated from the date and time of birth and also from the astrological tradition of the user s choice e g Western or Chinese Calculating someone s sign is a pretty specialized and involved calculation but is nevertheless something you can just call from an astrological library and calculate How would you design this database would you remove this functionally dependent attribute or would you calculate the user s sign once or every time she updates her date of birth then store it in the database and forget about the possibility of calculating a sign in the rest of your system or would you enforce the 3NF rule with an iron fist And how do you see the potential benefit of being able to tweak a user s sign if she insists that her sign should be different from the one that your algorithm is calculating Now suppose a new application You are building a system for the Army that chooses possible occupations for new conscripts Part of your system is a huge bad ass pattern recognition machine developed at ORNL that tells you what occupations will be allowed for the conscripts based on a whole lot of data that comes from your database This pattern recognition method looks at each person s height date of birth medical records school transcript and it also looks at a long list of answers the person gave to one of two questionnaires It also takes in consideration evaluation questionnaires filled by higher rank officers and the analysis that is made looks at all of the conscripts from each year at the same time to come up with a bunch of parameters for say a feed forward neural network This neural network is simpler than the whole of the pattern recognition system but it is still a pretty involved calculation not just a temperature unit conversion Nevertheless you can see it as a black box and it can tell you the fate from each of your conscripts when you pull his record form the database At a specific date in the Army s calendar the analysis is made the ANN parameters are found and now you can run the black box and tell each conscript what he will be doing for the next one year or two It s a pretty important thing You will be deciding people s occupations you will be sending some people to operate ovens at the kitchen and other to drive tanks Everyone will be logging in the Army s network to check out their occupations and see the result in their personal webpages Now the little black box is there and it outputs this important value based on the attributes pulled from your database The attributes and parameters will probably never change and the calculation of the conscript s destiny will probably be always correct always the same value form the first day But would you really leave that outside the database just to follow the remove calculated attributes rule This is not just some calculation of age astrological sign or temperature conversion The pattern recognition system is indeed a path to calculate an attribute But would you really like to keep that inside your system forever re calculating this hugely important thing over and over again Or would you consider it better to calculate everything once and forget that this magical black box exists I mean just run all of this crazy pattern recognition code once some day then pick the results and record them in the database When someone logs in to see the output from his analysis make it so the query is just a boring data fetching procedure and leave all the pettern recognition excitement for another time Another more palpable situation You run a web store like Amazon You have a pattern recognition method to recommend books to people that is fed from a user s record in your DB Would you keep running the thing all the time you need the current recommendations or would you treat the pattern recognition box as something separate from the rest of the system just feeding its results to the database from where it can be read by other programs Wouldn t it be nice to have a control for example to make sure that you are not switching recommendations at an awkward moment Don t worry too much about computational burden assume excellent memory and computational resources TL DR Do you think the rule of removing calculated attributes should never be broken or would you say it is OK to store in the database the results from very important attributes that are calculated by very complex and delicate pattern recognition methods Aren t there situations where we should just pretend that you actually cannot perform the calculation on demand and just leave recorded there these results that won t be updated anyway,recognition

I have been looking for a way to arrange JPG images based on the quality compression level of the images I want to do this so that I could select only those images which has less compression letâ s say 90 100 and batch process them to lower compression level say 75 to save hard disk space I have loads of reference images with various compression level If I apply compression to all the images then the ones with already low compression get reprocessed resulting really lower quality images Does anyone one know how could I select images based on the quality compression I would really appreciate any help Takias,jpeg
I have to implement a solution where two date ranges can overlap each other within the overlapped dates I have to count how many days overlap each other Once I know the overlapped days I can calculate a total figure based on the price that s attached per day A scenario would be thatA customer is booking a hotelCustomer booking dates 17 02 2011 to 26 02 2011Normal price All year 01 01 2011 31 12 2011 price per day 30 00 Special Offer 1 dates 01 01 2011 to 19 02 2011 price per day 20 00 Special Offer 2 dates 17 02 2011 to 24 02 2011 price per day 10 00 In the above scenario the proposed algorithm should work out the cheapest offer that the date ranges overlap and work out the price for the booking If there is no special offer available it uses the normal price So for the first two days the system should get the price from special offer 1 as it s the cheapest available price Next 5 days should be Special offer 2 price and for the next 2 days it ll be normal price I d be grateful to see both SQL using MS SQL Server or Code base answers to get the diffrenet views I hope the question is clear and looking foward to see the answers Many thanks in advance,classic

This is on Net 4 full framework I m trying to make a simple winforms app that will make some simple WCF REST calls It s using ChannelFactory and the service contract interface Of the 20 methods in the interface 2 of them involve Stream an upload and a download method so the service side and currently also the client side using TransferMode Streamed My goal is to include the full HTTP request and response much like you would see in ethereal wireshark or fiddler or whatever with headers in a textbox of the winforms app just to show what went over the wire In trying to use the built in diagnostics via SvcConfigEditor and my own via implementing IClientMessageInspector and then IEndpointBehavior to add the inspector then channelFactory Endpoint Behaviors Add to add the behavior I m having 2 issues When doing request ToString or reply ToString in BeforeSendRequest and AfterReceiveReply it only gets the body and not the headers Digging around in the objects in the debugger it looks like the reply has them in reply Properties httpResponse but the request s request Properties httpRequest has an empty Headers property even though Fiddler shows headers for Content Type Host Accept Encoding and Connection It seems like there s likely a better way to get the raw message that I m missing and if there s not someone probably knows an existing chunk of code to reconstruct the raw one from the Message Since the transfer mode is Streamed the body part just shows up as the string stream both in SvcTraceViewer and the raw svclog even with logEntireMessage true and when doing a ToString If the mode is Buffered instead it shows the actual body fine I tried making a copy with reply CreateBufferedCopy int MaxValue but that then caused the actual WCF call to fail with an InvalidOperationException This message cannot support the operation because it has been copied One fallback would be to move the client to Buffered and just change to StreamedRequest for the one upload call and StreamedResponse for the download call but I d have to do that programmatically AFAICT as it s set at the binding level in the config and I don t see anyway of doing it via attributes on the calls which would take care of the body part and leave me with just the get the http request headers issue 1 specifically request Properties httpRequest Headers being empty to deal with but I m hoping there s some way of logging the raw messages without doing so leaving the TransferMode as Streamed Thanks,http

Currently building alpha version currently a online Electronics store I ve been doing a lot of research doing the last few months as I was building the app on how and where from to get product images for the products that I will be sold online I haven t came to any reasonable conclusion the only option that surfaced during these months was to get the images directly from the manufactures My question is there a reliable source that aggregates most of the Electronic products and their images Think a stock photo website but for product images The site will cater to a small audience so getting images directly from the manufacturers I don t think is an option as I won t even be a blimp on their radar,products

Question Is there a general method which would let me determine if a laptop can support 2x external monitors Context Iâ m shopping for a laptop which would support my 2 main modes of operation In desk mode I do many hours of design work with OrCAD Altium SolidWorks Visio also write code in Visual Studio and Eclipse For that Iâ d like to have 2x large external monitors If needed monitors can be connected through dock station If it s possible to choose between portrait and landscape orientation of monitors that would be a bonus In field mode I still need to run CAD packages but only to look up and tweak things occasionally Field mode happens in vanilla indoor environments so ruggedness and ingress protection are not needed It would be nice if the laptop had a small footprint like a 13â laptop perhaps At the same time weight and thickness of the laptop are not a problem for me Of course I also wonder if this is realistic at all Update I m checking looking into Maxtor DualHead2Go which was suggested in several other threads Update Found something curious The hp 120W Advanced Docking Station has 2x DisplayPorts source Item 11 on the drawing Sounds like there ought to be an hp laptop which would do 2x external monies Could these DisplayPorts be daisy chained inside docking station Update Lenovo Mini Dock Plus also has 2x DisplayPortLenovo had also put together a brief on multiple monitor setups PDF version Any suggestion insight or reference is really appreciated,station

In the early days of our company all our information came in on paper and all of what we sold was on paper Because of this we literally rent our an old bank vault to house the millions of sheets of paper that some say still contain relevant information That being said I m looking into purchasing some hardware capable of scanning all these documents and converting them to pdf Being new at this level of digitization I would like to ask for recommendations for accomplishing this task Most of this material exists as separate bound studies articles etc Someone would have to remove the bindings and be able to load many pages at a time and have the scanner feed them all through and convert them to a single pdf single pdf per study article etc If you have any recommendations I would very much appreciate hearing about them thanks,scanning

I have an ASP NET application pointing the 2 0 version of the framework written in C deployed in IIS6 I am maintaining the application therefore some of its parts are not clear to me The application has to send email messages through an external exchange server to and from oldMailAddress and has been done correctly Now I added a newMailAddress and I haven t changed anything else from the code The oldMailAddress receives the emails send through the application the newMailAddress doesn t I tried to send emails to newMailAddress from my mailbox and it works correctly I looked for solutions on the Internet and I saw that most of them are based on SMPT services installed in IIS6 Well I do not have these services installed and I think it is not necessary since the application was working with oldMailAddress Hereby I attach the code that I use I hope anybody might help MailMessage oMail new MailMessage switch destination case production strMailAddress newMailAdress domain eu oMail From new MailAddress strMailAddress oMail To Add strMailAddress break case warehouse strMailAddress oldMailAdress domain eu oMail From new MailAddress strMailAddress oMail To Add strMailAddress break oMail Subject sTitle oMail IsBodyHtml true oMail Body sHTML SmtpClient oSmpt new SmtpClient external smpt eu oSmpt Send oMail,server
Let s say I have an entity called MyItem It can be included in many parents like SomeCollection and SomeOtherCollection Because it can be included in many parents and since I don t want MyItem to know about the parents I d like to not have any properties in MyItem referencing a parent And since a parent like SomeCollection can contain many many MyItems I feel like I need to have some sort of paging involved in getting the children from a parent This would keep me from having a property in SomeCollection referencing MyItems Lazy loaded or not it s always all or nothing right I definitely need some reference between MyItem entities and their parents though in the form of a mapping table in the database Questions How do I create mappings for this Can I have mappings or should therelation be kept in the businesslogic instead How would I querywhich MyItem entities exist inSomeCollection Can I do this with only one trip to the database using ICriteria,mapping
I recently implemented ISC DHCP Failover and it s working beautifully but I d like to monitor the current status of the failover using Nagios Ultimately I would like my Nagios check to report a WARNING when the Secondary DHCP server kicks in starts serving addresses due to an issue with the Primary report a CRITICAL when both the Primary and Secondary aren t active Monitoring the dhcpd process to see if it is running or not is unfortunately not the true solution a failover state can activate even when dhcpd is still running From what I ve researched it appears dhcpd cannot be queried for a current status Aside from parsing log files does anyone know of a clean way to determine whether a dhcpd server is currently in a failover state or not,dhcp

I m trying to debug a webapp using Apache Camel from Eclipse and while I m tracing into I arrive at a point where Eclipse says that no source file is available and I can see bytecode shown in Eclipse where usually I see sourcecode but apparently I cannot advance into that bytecode I try F6 Step Over but nothing happens anyway not that it would have been that useful compared to source code So how are you supposed to trace into such a beast I m wondering if all these code generating code intercepting layers aren t creating more problems than they re trying to solve It seems like it s helpful as long as everything works but as soon as there s a problem things become very hard to diagnose EDIT I don t want to trace Apache Camel itself I just want to trace a program that is using Apache Camel and I realize that things quickly gets very messy basically you kinda lose your tracing ability because you jump from your Java source code to something,apache

First a few caveats We are building a small medium sized system that is anticipated to have a lifespan of 2 5 years relatively short The system is being developed with Entity Framework 4 1 Code First MVC3 We are trying to push our team towards unit testing TDD It is something that we have not done but we recognize its value so are taking baby steps in that direction With all of that in mind we have decided to build unit tests with Visual Studio 2010 s built in testing framework We are NOT using the repository pattern or mocks This is to reduce the complexity and time spent building the unit tests Each unit test is really more of an integration test we have a test database that gets initialized each time the tests are run and each test uses the same controllers that the views use to get as close as we can to real world behavior of the system When commenting or answering this question please do not attack this approach I am well aware that this is not TDD in its purest form nor is it the ideal pattern for testing units of work We are doing it this way to get our feet wet with the technology and try to get the most bang for our buck in terms of time spent building the unit tests The Problem We are building a lot of unit tests that store an object via a controller then retrieve the object from the database through the controller to verify that it was stored correctly and that it comes back through our controller the way we would expect Here is an example TestMethod public void Edit_Post_Saves_OperatingCompany_In_DB_When_OperatingCompany_Is_Valid OperatingCompany opco new OperatingCompany opco Name OpCo Edit Post Valid DB Save controller new OperatingCompanyController controller Create opco Guid opcoid opco Id controller new OperatingCompanyController opco OperatingCompany ViewResult controller Edit opcoid Model opco Name Edit OpCo Edit Post Valid DB Save controller new OperatingCompanyController HelperMethods AddValidationResultsToModelState opco controller controller Edit opco controller new OperatingCompanyController ViewResult result controller Index Assert IsTrue IEnumerable lt OperatingCompany gt result Model Contains opco The error we are getting is this Test method WebObjects Tests Controllers OperatingCompanyControllerTest Edit_Post_Saves_OperatingCompany_In_DB_When_OperatingCompany_Is_Valid threw exception System InvalidOperationException An entity object cannot be referenced by multiple instances of IEntityChangeTracker I am pretty sure this is occuring because the entity in question isn t being detached from the context of the first controller and when we reinstantiate it and try to edit the same entity it thinks another context still has ahold of it The reason we are reinstantiating the controller is to ensure that the entity is being pulled back from the database and not just being returned from the cache of the DbContext please correct me if I am wrong here but I believe that is what would be happening if we didn t reinstantiate We were able to get this to work by explicitly detaching every object from the context after every call to SaveChanges as well as detaching when we query objects via the context in our controllers but I don t want to do that just to get our unit tests to work plus I am sure it would be a significant performance hit The Question Is there some better way to perform this type of integration test with our controllers,testing
What is the most accurate way to automatically calculate the text baseline in an image that has been rendered from a TeX snippetâ so that the rendered image can be given proper vertical alignment in a block of text My current approach which isnâ t working in all cases Hereâ s an example of what Iâ m trying to do Note that these are screenshots of a web page HTMLÂ CSSÂ LatinÂ Modern fonts for web and not of a TeX document The web page is mostly paragraphs of text but contains embedded PNG images rendered TeX snippets for the formulas involving square roots Hereâ s how I want it to look But hereâ s what Iâ m getting The secondâ the smallerâ square root formula is aligned correctly and it was done automatically Iâ m calculating the baseline by first rendering a snippet consisting of only a â â character and then by measuring the height of the resulting image after cropping away everything below the â â this tells me how much I need to lower the image using CSSâ s vertical align style in order to align it with the surrounding textâ s baseline This works well for formulas that arenâ t too tall Where it fails is well taller formulas as shown above In the case of the firstâ the largerâ square root formula it needs to be lowered less than normal because it extends higher than normal My calculations for this are currently wrong and Iâ m wondering how I can fix this Alternatives What are some ways of measuring the baseline in pixels of a snippet I canâ t really use documentclass standalone for this because it crops the page as tightly as possible which produces different image heights for x X and sqrt x Iâ m thinking I may need to render a calibration snippet consisting of two blank lines prior to a lone or perhaps a bottom aligned horizontal rule instead of just a single characterâ but that seems a bit kludgey Is there a way to coax TeX into not placing a formula lower on the page when it is taller than standard text That is is there some way I can cause a formula at the top of a page to protrude upward into the top margin A second problemI also noticed that Iâ m seeing sub pixel alignment problems Below are screenshots scaled up to 400 actual size This formula is Â¾ pixel too low At first I thought I was calculating the vertical align value wrong so I manually moved it up by one pixel but then it turns out that it s Â¼ pixel too highâ which means the problem lies within the image rather than the alignment value I suspect this is fixable by making sure I round the image heights up to the nearest multiple of 4 before I downsample them for embedding in the page Just wondering if anyone has tackled this problem before and has any tips Iâ m encouraged by these results so far but doing this correctly turns out to be a lot more subtle than I expected it would be NaÃ vely when I first started this I hadnâ t considered tall formulas or even vertical alignment at all,mode

I have been so confused lately regarding difference between predicate and function in first order logic My understanding so far is Predicate is to show a comparison or showing a relation between two objects such as President Obama America Functions are to specify what a particular object is such as Human Obama Now am I heading on right track to differentiate these two terms or I am completely wrong and need a brief explanation I would like to have opinion from expert to clarify my knowledge or approve my understanding Thanks in advanceKrio,agent
The particle filter algorithm is known for its use in tracking objects in a video sequence at each iteration the algorithm generates hypotheses or samples about the motion of the object In order to generate a new hypothesis the first step of the condensation algorithm involves the selection of a sample the example provided in this web page shows an implementation of the selection step which uses the binary search in order to pick a base sample the comment in support of the pick_base_sample function explains that The use of this routine makes Condensation O NlogN where N is the number of samples It is probably better to pick base samples deterministically since then the algorithm is O N and probably marginally more efficient but this routine is kept here for conceptual simplicity and because it maps better to the published literature What it means to pick base samples deterministically How to pick base samples deterministically,particle

I have looked through several question about AJAX and character encoding but I can only seem to find questions about the response s encoding but not where the data sent to the server s encoding I am sending a form serialized using jQuery to the server PHP then saves this form s fields to a database The database uses latin1 swedish ci The page with the form uses iso 8859 1 When I do this by using AJAX to send the data to the server characters like â get converted to Ã â Å on the way to the server and get saved in the database as such When I skip the AJAX and use a normal html form submit the characters turn out fine in the database It is obvious that the jQuery serialization of the form data and the AJAX submission are what s causing the characters to get mangled but how can I fix this I have tried changing the contentType of the AJAX call I have tried using iconv to convert the characters server side which causes errors or incorrect translations I have tried to use utf8_decode server side but this converts it into a question mark I cannot change the output pages to UTF 8 encoding because this causes other problems with other content on these pages Ideally the solution would prevent the characters from being saved in the database wrong in the first place as would happen with a normal html form submit Any ideas on how to solve this javascript that sends the form to the server BlogEditForm prototype save function var self this ajax type POST url blog_edit_ajax php dataType json data self dialog find form serialize success function response self processSaveResponse call self response,encoding

When using the boost regex class with the optional ICU support enabled see boost documentation for details I seem to get a memory leak or rather some sort of caching of memory happening which I cannot seem to reset cleanup Has anyone else seen this and maybe knows of a way of clearing the cache so that the boost unit test framework will not report a memory leak The details for my problem are ICU version 4 6 0 Built using supplied vs2010 solution in debug and release configuration Boost version 1 45 built with command bjam variant debug release threading multi link shared stage since standard distribution does not include icu support in regex OS Windows 7Compiler MSVC 10 Visual Studio 2010 Premium Though I did try this with a boost 1 42 with icu 4 2 1 which I happened to have built on my system with same results so don t think its a problem which would be solved by changing to boost 1 47 icu 4 8 1 which are the latest versions Compiling the following code Test cpp define BOOST_TEST_MAIN Ask boost unit test framework to create a main for us define BOOST_ALL_DYN_LINK Ask boost to link to dynamic library rather than purely header support where appropriate include lt boost test auto_unit_test hpp gt include lt boost regex hpp gt include lt boost regex icu hpp gt We use icu extensions to regex to support unicode searches on utf 8 include lt unicode uclean h gt We want to be able to clean up ICU cached objectsBOOST_AUTO_TEST_CASE standard_regex boost regex re d 3 BOOST_AUTO_TEST_CASE u32_regex boost u32regex re boost make_u32regex d 3 u_cleanup Ask the ICU library to clean up any cached memory Which can be compiled from a command line by C gt cl test cpp I BOOST HEADERS PATH I ICU HEADERS EHsc MDd link LIBPATH BOOST LIB PATH ICU LIB PATH icuuc libWith the appropriate paths to headers libs for your machineCopy the appropriate boost dlls to the directory containing test exe if they are not pathed in boost_regex vc100 mt gd 1_45 dll and boost_unit_test_framework vc100 mt gd 1_45 dll When test exe from above steps is run I get Running 2 test cases No errors detectedDetected memory leaks Dumping objects gt 789 normal block at 0x00410E88 28 bytes long Data lt 0N U gt 00 00 00 00 30 4E CD 55 00 00 00 00 01 00 00 00 788 normal block at 0x00416350 14 bytes long Data lt icudt46l coll gt 69 63 75 64 74 34 36 6C 2D 63 6F 6C 6C 00 787 normal block at 0x00415A58 5 bytes long Data lt root gt 72 6F 6F 74 00 lots of other blocks removed for clarity I m guessing that icu is actually the culprit here since there it has its name at the start of the 2nd block Just doing the 1st test ie just creating a standard regex not a u32_regex has no memory leaks detected Adding multiple u32_regex s to the test does not result in more memory being leaked I attempted to clean up the icu cache by using the u_cleanup call as per the icu documentation see the ICU Initialization and Termination section However I am not very familiar with the icu library actually am only using it because we wanted unicode aware regex support and can t see how to get the u_cleanup call to actually clean up the data when ICU is being loaded by the boost regex dll Just to reiterate the problem appears to be boost regex in a dll compiled with optional icu support I m pretty sure this uses a static link to icu but may be wrong here If I link to icuuc lib in test program so that I can call u_cleanup this doesn t appear to affect the memory held by the instance of ICU loaded via the boost regex library well it would be rather odd if it did I can t find any calls in regex library which allow me to ask it to cleanup the ICU data which is really where we want to make the call,regex

I have the problem that I want to include a outputfile from a custom build step in a setup project Since the add project output option only adds the exe from the solution and not the custom output my first approach was to add it as a file In this case the file is put under source control and write protected Normally the files wont be checked out for building a new version and the custom step fails and so the whole build process So I want to dynamically use the output from the custom build step and not the file it self to resolve my problem Is there any solution for this issue,project

Looking for some insight as to whether an Upsert insert or if exists then update procedure is considered bad practice in database programming I work in SQL server if that bears any relevance At a place I worked some months ago the the resident DB guru stated in newly written db coding standards most of which I agreed with that Upserts should be avoided I can t really see a logical reason for this and consider my self reasonably conscious of good programming practice I think they are useful for straight forward data management and help to avoid excessive stored procedure numbers Looking for some insight discussion that will help me come to a conclusion on this Thanks Update In response to comments The specific context I refer to is the creation or update of a domain entity data representation in the database Say for example a Person object exists as a representation of the Person table in the database I simply need a mechanism for creating a new Person or updating an existing one Here I have the option of creating an Upsert stored procedure or two separate stored procedures one for Update and one for Insert Any advantages or disadvantages in anyones view,database

I created a small javascript webapp that uses navigator geolocation watchPosition to track the visitor s position From the data I receive I notice that the best accuracy from my measurements is 5m I thought this would be enough to calculate a maximum and current speed But it seems that the speeds are not that accurate I sometimes get results with a 10km h difference compared to a real gps app Is this a limitation for a webapp or is it a mistake I am making in my calculations To calculate the speed I compare the current position to the last position and calculate the difference time,gps

So I am in the process of redesigning a small database and potentially a much larger one but want to show the value of using revisions history of the business objects I am switching the data from Access to MSSQL 2008 I am having a lot of internal debate on what version of revision history to use in the design itself and thought I had decided to add a RevisionId to all tables With this design adding a RevisionId to all tables we would like tracked what would be the best way to create Navigational Properties and Relationships between two tables such as Vendor VendorContact where a Vendor can have multiple contacts The Contacts themselves will be under revision Will it require custom extensions or am I over thinking this Thanks in advance,framework

I m new to Ruby on Rails and I m in the process of setting it up on my OS X system Most guides seem to recommend using MacPorts to install Ruby and RubyGems then using RubyGems from there on to install gems I ve noticed that MacPorts also offers many gems though they re missing some and others seem a few releases behind and I m worried that it will somehow conflict with the stuff I m installing using RubyGems Does anyone have any experience working with this kind of setup Any advice I want to get this right the first time so I don t end up having things break later on Thanks Grant,osx

well I ve been thinking of making database requests a little faster by keeping the connection to the database open as long as the object is being used So I was thinking of opening the connection in the constructor of that class Now the question is how can I close the connection after I stopped using I have to call close somewhere don t I I ve been reading about the finalize method but people seemed to be skeptical about usage of this method anywhere at all I d expect it to have something like a destructor but Java doesn t have that so So could anyone provide me with a solution Thanks in advance,destructor
i have recently purchased TP Link TL WR740N but somehow it is not working properly I do not have ISP connection rather i have fixed IP connectivity so that i get a 100Mbps ethernet cable coming for switch with fixed static IP Address which previously i was connecting directly to my laptop and it was working perfectly Now with this new router i setup everything configured WAN settings and plugged the cable that i plugged to my laptop It works but Every time i open a webpage it takes forever to open or might be some part of page loads and then it just hangs in a waiting state Things do not change no matter i use it over wireless or secondary wired port LAN Is there some specific settings that i should do here to make it work Considering i have IP Connectivity at backend would that require some specific settings I googled and something tells me about MTU but not sure if i should mingle with it any suggestions,mtu
I have a struct which is POD but for convenience I want it to have std initializer_list ctor Default ctor copy ctor and dtor are implicit It seems however that using initializer_list ctor disqualifies the struct as POD hence it cannot be inside a union include lt initializer_list gt struct A A const std initializer_list lt int gt amp union A a a gcc 4 6 std c 0x error use of deleted function â lt anonymous union gt _0 â error â lt anonymous union gt _0 â is implicitly deleted because the default definition would be ill formed error no matching function for call to â A A â Is there away around it Is it related to the unrestricted unions feature of c 11,unions
I am not a DBA and so dont really know anything about SQL 2005 security settings etc I am attempting to set up an empty copy of our database by generating the full database from SQL Management Studio generated scripts Unfortunately I don t know what many of the options do and the MSFT documentation of this processes isn t great There is an option to generate script for Schemas Tables Views and Users It is the users I am confused about because I don t understand how they affect the usage of the database We have some developers in the team who are in this list and some who are not yet everyone can do anything on the database at least when they are hosting it on their own machines Do I need to keep these Users in my new generated database and what do they do We also have a dbo User who is a db_owner and owns many of our schemas What is this dbo User What is the significance of a user Owning Schemas We use Schemas as namespaces to group logically related tables in our database but I take it there is more to them than that There is also a username tied to this dbo User its the windows NT login of one of our developers but he doesn t have his own User object in the list is there any significance to this Is this a bad thing Other Users are guest INFORMATION_SCHEMA and sys but I think these are all defaults Sorry but I am a SQL admin ignoramus and usually left these things to the DBA in my previous job Thanks for any help,permissions

Matthieu M brought up a pattern for access protection in this answer that i d seen before but never conciously considered a pattern class SomeKey friend class Foo SomeKey possibly make it non copyable too class Bar public void protectedMethod SomeKey Here only a friend of the key class has access to protectedMethod class Foo void do_stuff Bar amp b b protectedMethod SomeKey fine Foo is friend of SomeKey class Baz void do_stuff Bar amp b b protectedMethod SomeKey error SomeKey SomeKey is private It allows more fine granular access control than making Foo a friend of Bar and avoids more complicated proxying patterns Does anyone know whether this approach already has a name i e is a known pattern,access

This question has no doubt been asked in various forms in the past but not so much for a specific scenario What is the most correct way to stop a Thread that is blocking while waiting to receive a network message over UDP For example say I have the following Thread public class ClientDiscoveryEngine extends Thread private final int PORT public ClientDiscoveryEngine final int portNumber PORT portNumber Override public void run try socket new DatagramSocket RECEIVE_PORT while true final byte data new byte 256 final DatagramPacket packet new DatagramPacket data data length socket receive packet catch SocketException e do stuff 1 catch IOException e do stuff 2 Now would the more correct way be using the interrupt method For example adding the following method Overridepublic void interrupt super interrupt flip some state My only concern is is socket receive not a non interruptable blocking method The one way that I have thought of would be to implement the interrupt method as above in that method call socket close and then cater for it in the run method in the catch for the SocketException Or maybe instead of while true use some state that gets flipped in the interrupt method Is this the best way Or is there a more elegant way Thanks,handling
I have a web view that loads a url on request However when this web view reloads the same url the content does not get updated but remains as it was after it was first loaded I m assuming this is due to automatic caching Deleting the apps documents and data allows the webview to be refreshed but then the issue occurs again,uiwebview

Background In the process of creating an android application I am messing around with different hashing techniques and speeds I was using the Android native stuff until I found SpongyCastle i e BouncyCastle which turned out to be a lot faster The SpongyCastle jar file is fairly large and my apk is over 800kb with just the jar and a couple of testing classes and all of the necessary android fluff Question pt 1 Is this normal for jar files to do to an APK Do they usually bloat out the file Question pt 2 Is there any way for me either via source or jar to cut down the file I m only using the SHA256 and SHA1 hash schemes and I have not been able to figure out how to use just those two hash schemes without including the entire jar Thoughts Edited ProGuard works wonders,reduce

We have 8 million row table and we need to add a sequential id column to it It is used for data warehousing From testing we know that if we remove all the indexes including the primary key index adding a new sequential id column was like 10x faster I still haven t figure out why dropping the indexes would help adding a identity column Here is the SQL that add identity column ALTER TABLE MyTable ADD MyTableSeqId BIGINT IDENTITY 1 1 However the table in question has dependencies thus I cannot drop the primary key index unless I remove all the FK constraints As a result adding identity column Is there other ways to improve the speed when adding a identity column so that client down time is minimal orIs there a way to add an identity column without locking the table so that table can be access or at least be queried The database is SQL Server 2005 Standard Edition,data

A while back I asked our developers to use rebase instead of merge before pushing Eliminating trivial merges makes for a much easier to follow commit graph ie gitk git log Sometimes folks still accidentally do trivial merges then push Does anyone have handy or have tips for writing a server side hook that blocks trivial merges By trivial merge I mean a merge without conflicts Here s an example and here s a better explanation of a trivial merge in git Update Wed Nov 10 01 26 41 UTC 2010 great comments all Thank you Here s what I m trying to avoid It really is hard to follow Consider the following all I m really asking folks to do is this if git pull ff only fails do git pull rebase instead of git pullgit git only has one or two committers right In theory it should be easy to follow the commit graph but it looks pretty messy to me Update Thu Nov 11 23 49 35 UTC 2010 here s a gist with some in progress workanother idea is to prevent trivial merges on the client end with a git push wrapperUpdate Wed Dec 15 18 34 52 UTC 2010 adymitruk is close Just one case is still unresolved non trivial merges must still work A rather complete test suite is available check it out I asked for help on a the git mailing list,githooks

I wrote a long parameterized test one of whose parameters is a constructor call with double brace syntax to construct a different object for each row of the 2D array Object data new Object 1 2 3 new Blah setA 1 2 3 new Blah setB Since the philosophy of JUnit is to call the test case constructor on each Test I was assuming that it would do the same with parameterized tests but I m seeing that it s only calling that constructor the constructor defined for the parameterized test once per row not once per test per row So the test fields are behaving globally and tests are affecting each other I want to know if there s a way to force the runner to call the constructor for each tests as with the regular JUnit runner Google and the JUnit pages are not helping me on this case I d really rather not rewrite the entire test which is extensive and fairly readable at this point,test
Skolem s Paradox tells us that countability in first order logic is relative Relative to what Below is what I ve gathered Countability it relative to 1 what a model takes to be mathbb N 2 what bijections between mathbb N and some set A a model recognizes Two examples For 1 Let be a model such that A is uncountable in We add a bijection between A and mathbb N to and call this new model A is countable in As mentioned here For 2 The underlying set of a model might be countable from the perspective of a larger model and so might see mathbb N differently than I m not sure if I ve said this right but here is a post on this,set
Suppose we find some problem X that is in BPP but not in P Also suppose we have access to a random oracle R Do X and R allow us to break any claimed secure pseudo random number generator Note that I m unfamiliar with the literature If this issue is already explored I m unlikely to know that and links to relevant papers would be appreciated I m defining a secure pseudo random number generator as taking some constant sized seed and generating a bit stream which is indistinguishable from random by a BPP adversary To show a bit stream is pseudo random we just need to find an instance of X where using the bit stream as a random oracle when solving X gets the wrong answer too often Such an instance must exist or else X would be in P To probabilistically determine that the wrong answer is being returned we compare against using R as the entropy source Keeping in mind that finding an appropriate instance of X might be too hard obviously a fixed instance can t work that assuming access to a true random oracle is a pretty strong condition and probably other omitted details that might make things not work Is it suspected that BPP neq P implies that there are no secure PRNGs,polynomial

In Silverlight with RIA services it is very easy to implement simple data filtering with FilterDescriptor instances However I ve got a case where I have several filters and I want to enable or disable them based on other filters It seems like a simple Enabled property would make this really easy but there is none Is there a way to achieve this without just manually defining all the filters I need every time the relevant checkbox is checked Perhaps a subclass I haven t had time to try this myself yet,ria

I often get confused aboutwhen a Markov chain has an equilibrium distribution when this equilibrium distribution is unique which starting states converge to the equilibrium distribution and how finite and countably infinite Markov chains different with respect to the above Google isn t quite clearing up my confusion Is the following correct am I missing anything An irreducible Markov chain finite or countably infinite has a unique equilibrium distribution if and only if all states are positive recurrent What about reducible Markov chains A reducible Markov chain has a non unique equilibrium distribution iff all states are positive recurrent However not all starting states necessarily converge to the unique equilibrium unless the Markov chain is also aperiodic that is an irreducible Markov chain converges to its unique equilibrium regardless of initial state if and only if all states are positive recurrent and aperiodic,chains

I just barely learned how to use a function in parallel The following line of code calculates the square value of an index and places it in an array called squares at that index The parallel_for function is available in Visual Studio 2010 as part of the Concurrency namespace under the header parallel_for static_cast lt size_t gt 0 count amp squares size_t n squares n n 1 n 1 You can see that it uses a lambda expression to calculate the squares in parallel and this code does work and compile correctly However the lambda expression clutters the parallel_for function with code I was thinking of just defining the lambda expression within a function object for example function lt void size_t gt Squares amp squares size_t n squares n n 1 n 1 My question is how can I use this function Squares within the parallel_for function Did I write the Squares function incorrectly or is this just a paradigm of the parallel_for to use lambda expression You can go ahead and recommend some other parallel libraries to me other than Microsoft s but I d still like to know the answer to my question,visual
i ve got an Extensionpoint here which points to an interface public interface IModelProcessor public void processModel Object diagramModel So each plugin which wants to usw that Extensionppoint has to provide an IModelProcessor with processModel Object diagramModel My Question is How can I now get return values from eclipse plug ins which implement this Extensionpoint I could of course use an return value somethin like this public ReturnContainer processModel Object diagramModel But since not every plug in will deliver a return value I d had to make the convention that plug ins should return null in this case which is in my opinion rather dirty What you think about that public void processModel Object diagramModel Observer returnObserver So each plug in which wants to deliver return values can register that Observer ofc the plug in would have to be Observable and call the update method on it What you think about that,pde
Does anybody have experience with JSR 330 vs Guice From what I gather Guice is not an implementation of JSR 330 but if it is anything like Hibernate and JPA the implementation supports a bunch of additional functionality no in the API Since I am already using GWT Dispatch Warp persist guice serlvet etc would there be anything gained by moving to an EJB container supporting JSR 330,guice
My friend likes to stream movies through Netflix on her 360 and the problem with this is that Netflix does not usually provide subtitles or captioning on anything but foreign films A few select videos on their website are captioned but Xbox users are out of luck Me being hard of hearing I can t watch the movie Now I can sit at an angle where I see both my laptop and the TV I also know that many movies have subtitles uploaded probably illegally but I place full blame on Netflix for alienating the deaf community Using these two facts I had an idea for a program that would display subtitles on my screen as the movie plays I can t find anything that will just play subtitles alone preferably in huge text so I can see it clearly while watching TV Does such a program exist,subtitles

Whats the easiest way to declare a two dimensional array in Objective C I am reading an matrix of numbers from a text file from a website and want to take the data and place it into a 3x3 matrix Once I read the URL into a string I create an NSArray and use the componentsSeparatedByString method to strip of the carriage return line feed and create each individual row I then get the count of the number of lines in the new array to get the individual values at each row This will give mw an array with a string of characters not a row of three individual values I just need to be able to take these values and create a two dimensional array,touch

I m finding it increasingly difficult to simulate actual user events using jQuery or native element trigger functions For example if you have a text input and you don t want the user to be able to add a character you can call e preventDefault with the jQuery normalised event object on the keydown event However there is no way to programatically verify this test scenario The following test passes even without the call to preventDefault because the jQuery keydown trigger isn t a real event input val test trigger jQuery Event which 68 expect input toHaveValue test Without the correct code this test should fail because the input should have a value of testd 68 is the character code for d Does anyone know any methods or libraries to simulate real browser UI events,jasmine

We have all heard of how in a for loop we should do this for i 0 count count array i lt c i Do stuff while traversing array instead of this for i 0 i lt count array i Do stuff while traversing array for performance reasons i e initializing count would ve called count only once instead of calling count with every conditional check Does it then also make a difference if in a foreach loop I do this array do_something_that_returns_an_array foreach array as key gt val Do stuff while traversing array instead of this foreach do_something_that_returns_an_array as key gt val Do stuff while traversing array assuming circumstances allow me to use either That is does PHP call the function only once in both cases or is it like for where the second case would call the function again and again,foreach

Are developers actually likely to receive significant help by open sourcing a work in its unfinished stages or are open source consumers more likely to want something ready to use This is frequently cited as a benefit of open source but I haven t been able to find evidence of it outside of already established products,release
I have two applications one that provides a Web service let s call it ws provider the other one that is the client of this Web Service call it ws client This communication is protected through a 2 ways SSL Both servers have been correctly configured regarding this confidentiality restrictions certificates installation SSL configuration Tomcat parametrization The servers are running on Tomcat 5 5 for ws provider 6 for ws client Java 6 and uses Jax WS for providing consuming the web service When the user connects to the ws client application and executes the action that calls the ws provider web service the latter action generally fails with the following error com sun xml ws client ClientTransportException The server sent HTTP status code 400 No client certificate chain in this request

strange part is that I just said that it generally failed when calling the web service For some reasons sometimes I get a successfull attempt when calling the web service This generally happens if the user launches the action in the minute that follows his login to the application No I don t know why The web service request contains an attachment This attachment is a PDF file that is not bigger than 15Kb at least during all my tests successfull or failed this size was never exceeded So after many tests I tried to call the same web service without attaching any PDF file and the call was successfull For your information if the security constraints are disabled on the ws provider i e we do not use 2 ways SSL connexion anymore then the web service calls never fail So I imagine that I have to configure something on my web services or on Tomcat or to make the system working Any idea Java codeHere is the Java interface that provides the method call on ws client as you can see the

I am going to use Entity Framework and WCF in my application The suggested practice as I saw is using POCO with Entity Framework and also using POCO classes as DataContracts That is actually what POCO and Attributes are used for if I am not wrong However I am asked to use seperate classses for Entity Framework POCO s and WCF DataContracts And to use a mapper between POCO s and DataContracts Like Foo and FooContract with same properties I am on the first approachs side but I wonder if the second approach seperate classes approach provides flexibility to the application or is it just a waste of effort I will be grateful if you can share your thoughts and experiences about using seperate classes for POCO and DataContracts pros and cons about that,datacontract

Hey there I was just messing about in jsFiddle and attempted to make a simple drag and drop I did not bother with getting the offset etc so as soon as you click it centers around your mouse On mouse down I return false which I thought would stop the elements kind of ghost from appearing It did not I focus onto the body on mouse down just in case it was that but it did not help either So basically my question is how can I stop elements being selected You can find the fiddle here http jsfiddle net Wolfy87 HY2u4 Any help would be much appreciated Thanks EDIT I just tested it in safari and it is fine so far it only seems to be firefox,focus

Let H be a separable Hilbert space Let e_i _i be an orthonormal basis For any bounded linear map T we write whenever possible operatorname tr T sum_ i infty langle T e_i e_i rangle Now let L H be the set of bounded operators N H the set of nuclear operators We want to show i L H rightarrow N H quad T mapsto S mapsto operatorname tr TS is an isometric isomorphism By the ideal property of the nuclear operators it is easy to see that i is well defined linear and bounded with i leq 1 Recall that the operators langle cdot e_i rangle e_j form a basis of N H You easily see the operator is injective if the induced functional is zero it s preimage must have been zero too and surjective simply build up an operator T in L H which induces a given functional in N H Question How can I finish the proof with showing that i is an isometry,hilbert

When using CodeNarc for static code analysis on Groovy amp Grails code it is not able to figure out class hierarchies There is a private method in one service class say BaseService Another service class say ChildService extends the BaseService class One of the methods in the ChildService calls a private method defined in the BaseService But the BaseService class does not use the private method anywhere in its own class So when analyzing the BaseService class in isolation the private method will appear as unused But when we look at the class hierarchy we can understand one of its subclass is calling it So my question is how does CodeNarc miss that kind of dependency Doesn t static code analyzers build parse tree and analyze on it If not how does it analyze code Any insight into the internals of static code analysis is highly appreciated Thanks,code

I know that graph contractability is NP complete given G V_1 E_1 and H V_2 E_2 can a graph isomorphic to H be obtained from G by a sequence of edge contractions Consider the following variant of the contractibility problem Each node in the input graph is labeled with a unique bit string of arbitrary length The similarity of two nodes is defined to be the length of the longest common prefix of their labels the weight of an edge is the similarity between its endpoints At each step we are allowed contract any maximum weight edge u v and label the new node with the longest common prefix of the labels of u and v There may be several maximum weight edges However we must also preserve label uniqueness if some other node already has the new label we cannot contract the edge u v Our goal is to minimize the total length of the node labels Are the following problems NP hard Given a labeled graph G find a sequence of legal contractions that minimizes the total length of all node labels in the resulting graph Given two labeled graphs G and H is there a sequence of legal contractions that transforms G into H,hardness

In my rails app DB Postgresql I have a big table with about 10 million rows What I m trying to do is get a subset of this table through certain conditions which gets me a dataset of about 1 or 2 million rows and then group count this by one of the attributes which takes a few thousand different values It actually works Problem it is way too slow Like between 10 and 100 seconds to render the results depending on the size of the subset dataset What are my options here The ones I m thinking about I m an idiot and it shouldn t take so long Maybe there are ways to run such a query much faster If so I m all ears for ideas I should run these processes separately maybe in the background and store the results in another table that I could call later a bit like cachingI can keep things like this but render the results progressively in the view or set up a good looking progress bar Use specific tools for big data queries,performance

It seems like I see a lot of class methods in Objective C that are like NSString stringWithString NSString string or NSArray arrayWithArray NSArray array etc I am just starting to consider design patterns and to me these methods look like little factories that produce specific implementations of strings or arrays based on the paramaters provided stringWith string string ByAppendingString In essence this looks a lot like the factory method with parameters demonstrated in the book Design Patterns Is there a better way to do this Should I be creating interfaces that mix these class methods and instance methods or create Factory only objects that do not have any instance methods I am confused,factory

In an ASP NET MVC application how should the sending of emails be handled I ve been thinking about this and I really like the idea of handling it in an MVC oriented way it is an MVC application after all What I mean is that the email that gets delivered to the user is really just a view that should have a model passed to it This raises some questions How should we deliver views to both the requesting browser and an SMTP server at the same time when an action is executed Does the framework have any facilities to support this If not is there some 3rd party release guidance for this sort of functionality The alternatives to treating email sending in an MVC way are Email sending code shows up in the controller s action methods Email sending is a behavior of the Model objects How are you handling the sending of emails in your ASP NET MVC applications What do you think about an MVC oriented approach,net

C 11 offers features like thread safe initialization of static variables and citing that question we ll say for instance Logger amp g_logger static Logger lg return lg So ostensibly this is true regardless of whether a module compiled with a C 11 compiler included the thread headers or spawned any threads in its body You re offered the guarantee even if it were linked against another module that used C 11 threads and called the function But what if your other module that calls into this code wasn t using C 11 threads but something like Qt s QThread Is atomic initialization of statics then outside of the scope of C 11 s ability to make such a guarantee Or does the mere fact of a module having been compiled with C 11 and then linked against other C 11 code imply that you will get the guarantee regardless Does anyone know a good reference where issues like this are covered,language

I added some custom products in virtuemart from my custom component and added its weight and other attributes but fedex v2 does not get shipping rates for my custom added products while it get the shipping rates for other normal products I want to know that which attribute does fedex v2 use So that I can check about those USPS is also getting rates for normal products and also for my custom product But there seems to be some attribute that is wrong with my newly added custom product So I want to know that what are the required attributes for fedex v2 Please tell if you know this or if you know fedex v2 attributes used from virtuemart then that is better Because without that I think it is useless to change so many attributes one by one and without any certainty Please tell whatever you know about that any clue will be appreciated as I don t know much about that,fedex

I use some xbee s2 modules with zb stack for mesh networking evaluation Therefore a multi hopping environment has to be created The problem is that the firmware handles the association for themselves and there is no way deeper into the stack as the api provides To force the path of the data without to disturb the routing mechanism I have tried to measure I had to put them outside their reach To get only the next hop in association isn t that easy I used the least power level of the output but the distance for the test setup is to large and the rf characteristics of the environment change undetermined Therefore my question has anyone experience with this issue Regards Toby,network

I m relative new to Spring so there is a thing not very obvious for me Namely the fact that controllers are singletons I agree that this is a good approach but this doesn t let me implement a thing that I used to implement with other frameworks I build a web application which throughout uses AJAX requests I have controllers hierarchy with BaseController as parent and all other controllers extend it Controller actions which should return response to the client are annotated with the ResponseBody annotation and return serialized JSON string to the client Method createJSONResponse which performs this serialization is implemented in the BaseController and the main idea here is that each of the child controllers actions populates a map Map lt String Object gt responseMap with the required for client data and then this map is accessed in the BaseController and serialized I don t want to create new instance of responseMap in every action and I don t want to pass it every time as a parameter for createJSONResponse I achieved this with other framework by declaring responseMap in BaseController as protected property I can t do this with Spring since all controllers are singletons and I will not have new instance of responseMap with every request I m not sure making BaseController request scoped is a good idea I created a helper class as request scoped bean and declared responseMap in this helper Then I injected this bean as Autowired in BaseController I also moved out createJSONResponse method in this helper Then from controllers I populate this map as helper responseMap add lt somedata gt and call helper createResponseMap In this case responseMap becomes empty in createResponseMap it does not contain data populated in controller action It somehow goes out that responseMAp is not thread safe and it is moving from thread to thread with each async request Are there any ways to achieve functionality I need SOLVED BY A WORKAROUND Solved the problem by instantiating responseMap before every request and adding to the HttpServletRequest object in request interceptor Then createJSONResponse method and responseMap population methods refer to the getRequestMap method which gets responseMap from the HttpServletRequest P S Still will be glad to know the better solution,controller

I need to calculate the distance between GPS co ordinates to calculate distance traveled I ve tried both the Haversine and Vincenty algorithms which work fine on my desktop PC but when I port the code to the dsPIC they return 0 for points that are close within several meters due to a lack of floating point precision and poor implementations of sin and cos For my use case my points will be no more than 10 meters apart and will all fall within 10km of each other I ve tried the following algorithm and the results seem ok double dist double latA double lonA double latB double lonB double latD fabs latA latB 111 3 double lonD fabs lonA lonB 111 3 cos latA 3 14159265 180 return sqrt latD latD lonD lonD 1000 Assuming the distance for every 1Â is 111 3km I use the pythagorean theorem to calculate distance Is there any easy way to improve my algorithm Or are there any other algorithms that don t depend on a highly accurate sin cos,floating

I m getting started with KML and would like to know how to proceed with some special features of my project I am working on a map of India in 500BCE This raises a number of issues Uncertainty Many of the places I want to map are uncertain and can only be specified in approximate terms Places fall into 3 categories known places like Rajagaha Rajgir uncertain but with uniquely identifiable features eg on the road between Rajagaha and Nalanda uncertain and non unique such as towns that are specified only as being in a certain region So how should I approach this The first category is unproblematic For the second one I would like to indicate a place while clearly alerting the user that it is no more than an educated guess For the third we can to no better than placing a list of towns etc inside a region Can this be captured in a useful way in KML Multiple Names Many of the places have multiple names whether variant readings in the texts or translated names in Chinese and so on Is it possible to record a list of alternative names with the KML data Of course only one of these will be displayed but the others are there for interfacing with other applications For example someone s reading a text they come across a place name in Chinese and Bingo they can go to the map which has the name in Pali,api

I can t seem to find an answer to this Heavy web stack spring struts2 hibernate Every project I work on I m faced with a conflict between front end and backend Dev The project will rely upon the app being built and deployed for it to start ie spring application context xml will fail without classes so we can t just deploy the git repo Yet front end development will want the changes to be visible without waiting for a full build deploy They can work on the live project and then reintegrate changed files back into the source repo but this exposes the project to risks such as lost work or incomplete incorrect checkin due to added complexity Is there some magic bullet that will let ID work on a project with their preferred plain text editor where they won t need to wait for build cycles to preview changes there must be something better than these options Eclipse maven run on server can still take 30 or 60 seconds to get a preview up drives me crazy as a backend dev Frameworks like play are not an option I m just thinking now maybe having a static web module that builds with a dynamic web module may be the answer Ie have maven pick files up from both So then the frontend guys can just deploy the static content and work on it,weblogic

I have a SQL server MS SQL 2005 in my development environment I have a suite of unit tests for some net code that will connect to the database and perform some operations If the code under test works correctly then the database should be in the same or similar state to how it was before the tests However I would like to be able to roll back the database to its state from before the tests run One way of doing this would be to programmatically use transactions to roll back each test operation but this is difficult and cumbersome to program it could easily lead to errors in the test code I would like to be able to run my tests confidently knowing that if they destroy my tables I can quickly restore them What is a good way to save a snapshot of one of my databases with its tables so that I can easily restore the database to it s state from before the test,rollback

I m having a problem with distributed transactions I m using SQL Server 2008 R2 Windows 7 Net 4 0 Here s what I actually want to do I have a buffer database named A I have another database named B I want to send data from database A to database B through a WCF webservice SOAP over HTTP A and B not on the same machine If the data is successfully sent to database B data is removed from database APlease note that this is a very simplified description of the problem I m currently having In my real application I m not replicating data between multiple SQL Server instances see update at the end of the post Everything is part of a transaction so the whole operation is atomic Here s what I m currently trying to do sequentially everything in a transaction I read a chunk from database A say 50 rows I update rows read in step 1 I actually set the boolean Sent column of rows with the value true so in the future I know that these rows are sent I consume client side a WCF webservice SOAP 1 2 wsHttpBinding that is part of the transaction flow blocking synchronous call The webservice request sends the data read in step 1The webservice implementation server side inserts data in database B data that is contained in the webservice request if no exception is received from the server data with the Sent value as true are removed from database Aif a specific FaultException is received from the server data with the Sent value as true are removed from database Afor other FaultExceptions and other exceptions endpoint not found or anything else data with the Sent value as true are not removed from database A Note there are actually multiple buffer databases A1 A2 A3 AN and multiple target databases B1 BN There are N threads to deal with N databases If I run my server and my client everything is working just fine Data is transferred atomically per chunks from database A to database B When I brutally stop my client in the middle of the transaction process killed most of the time everything is fine i e data is not removed from database A nor added to database B But sometimes this is my actual problem my database B becomes locked The only option to unlock it is to terminate the server process When the problem occurs I can see in MSDTC that there is an active transaction note that in the screenshot there are 3 transactions as I m currently dealing with 3 buffer databases and 3 target databases but sometimes there is only 1 transaction even if there are 3 DB I see that database B is locked when trying to run a SELECT againt database B As you can see in the picture below my SELECT request is blocked by session ID 67 which corresponds to an INSERT in database B by the server process The lock remains forever no transaction timeout even after 1 hour until the server process is terminated I can t validate or cancel the transaction in MSDTC I get a warning saying that it cannot be aborted because it is not In Doubt Why does the database B remained locked If the client is terminated shouldn t the transaction fail and the lock on database B be released after some timeout Here s my code for server side Service interface ServiceContract public interface IService

locked for infinite time if my client s transaction is brutally terminated What should I change config and or code and or design to make it work as expected i e if my client process dies crashes I want the transaction to be aborted so the database B is not locked Thanks EDITI do think I over simplified the description of my actual use case It looks like I m actually doing a simple data replication between multiple SQL Server instances That s not well explained my bad that s not what I m trying to achieve I m not simply duplicating data I read from A on machine M1 then write to B on machine M2 but what s written is not what I ve read but some calculated value that comes from what was read I m pretty sure SQL Server replication services could handle business computation for me but I can t go this way for some reasons I can t use SQL Server replication because I m actually not responsible of the server side which writes to database B I m even not sure that there will be SQL Server on the other side could be a Java backoffice with MySQL PostgreSQL or anything I can t use SQL Server service broker or any message oriented middleware which would fit IMO for same reason potentially heterogeneous databases and environments I can t change the webservices thing because the interface is now defined and fixed I m stuck by WCF and I can t even change the binding configuration to use MSMQ or whatever because of interoperability requirements MSMQ is great for sure I m already using it in another part of the project but it s Windows only SOAP 1 2 is a standard protocol and SOAP 1 2 transactions are standard too WS Atomic implementation Maybe the WCF transaction thing is not a good idea actually If I have understood correctly how it actually works please correct me if I m wrong it simply allows to continue the transaction scope on server side which will require a transaction coordinator to be configured on server side which probably breaks my interoperability needs again there could be a database on server side that does not integrate well with the transaction coordinator,soap

After getting great help in securing against SQL injection from classic ASP protection against SQL injection I ve encountered a major issue which cannot be solved using parameterized queries name Trim Request QueryString name flds Trim Request QueryString flds sql set rowcount 0 select amp flds amp from TABLE where Name amp name amp From what I understand a parameterized query will protect against SQL injection in the WHERE clause in this case the name field flds is a comma separated list of parameters that the users wants returned As it is obvious it is very vulnerable to SQL injection One idea I have to secure my code is to have a statically generated dict of valid fields split the flds string by verify each one of the values against the dict and construct the SQL query that will consist of all the fields that are present in the dict It seems to me that although this method will work for security it will require me to modify the static list at every change in the database however rare those are Are there better proper ways of securing this code against SQL injection attacks,server

Introduction I m attempting and in part succeding in replacing a number of folders with mounted VHDs in Windows Server 2008 R2 in an attempt to emulate UNIX bahaviour with bind or loop mounts This has proven to reduce a number of problems related to extreme fragmentation due to a mix of large and small files and the occasional and unpredictable rewriting thereof A third party app is doing what it wants and I don t have the power to stop it It also makes it possible to snapshot in a reasonable way without duplicating everything The images are obviously regenerated as needed after the app breaks everything cp aT oldmount newmount Problem If the VHD image contains a NTFS filesystem Windows requires administrator perms in order to create files but not folders in the filesystem root directory This breaks the app when it attempts to make such files No it is not an option to make the image root one folder up in the hierarchy Thus far I ve solved this by using vFAT filesystems which don t do any perm checking but it would be very nice to have a few of the NTFS features like sparse files and per file compression I have tried fiddling with the perms I could think of but Full control does not entail creating files as far as I can tell TL DR How can I goad Windows Server 2008 R2 into letting users create and write files in the top level directory of a mounted NTFS file system Addition The app runs as my normal user ttbomk I gave my both Everyone and my user Full control permissions and set my user as the owner of the mount point the root folder of the mount I can create folders and edit existing files with no problems but when creating a file right click new text document I get a UAC confirmation dialogue with title Destination Folder Access Denied text You need to confirm this operation name not path of mount Date created Creation date of mount and options to Continue Skip or Cancel When creating a file manually like this it s just an annoyance The app just fails silently for a while then with great spectacle when the unwritten data is needed,windows

We are writing a c cli wrapper for native code that is polymorphic and would like to extend the polymorphism into the non native side as much as possible So far given a c cli class instance it is easy to retrieve the underlying native class but the trouble comes when trying to determine which c cli wrapper to use for a given native class instance It would be nice to be able to avoid a switch statement here but how Is there a more elegant object oriented solution Note that in the following code I use a prefix of M for C CLI types e g FresnelScatterer is a native class and MFresnelScatterer is the C CLI wrapper class for it The native c base class and inherited class class Scatterer public ScatterType Type Scatterer virtual Scatterer ScatterType GetType return Type Some virtual functions here class FresnelScatterer public Scatterer public virtual function overrides The c cli base class and inherited class public ref class MScatterer abstract public Scatterer m_Scatterer MScatterer MScatterer MScatterer mscatter m_Scatterer mscatter m_Scatterer MScatterer Scatterer scatter m_Scatterer scatter XmlElement The_Scatterer_Type int ScattererType virtual void initializeXMLdata ScattererType int m_Scatterer gt GetType virtual Scatterer convertXMLdata 0 MScatterer more wrapping here public ref class MFresnelScatterer MScatterer public MFresnelScatterer MScatterer MFresnelScatterer MFresnelScatterer mfscatter MScatterer mfscatter MFresnelScatterer FresnelScatterer mfscatter MScatterer mfscatter virtual void initializeXMLdata override MScatterer initializeXMLdata other init virtual Scatterer convertXMLdata override Scatterer FresnelScatterer sca new FresnelScatterer return sca An example where going from C CLI native C works nicely is here for each MScatterer mScatterer in readScene gt ScattererList m_Scene gt scattererList push_back mScatterer gt convertXMLdata But going from native c I cannot see how to teach C CLI which type my native object is without using a switch statement for uint i 0 i lt m_Scene gt scattererList size i switch m_Scene gt scattererList i gt GetType case SCA_FRESNEL MFresnelScatterer sca gcnew MFresnelScatterer FresnelScatterer m_Scene gt scattererList i sca gt initializeXMLdata ScattererList gt Add sca break other cases follow,polymorphism
I need a parser for an exotic programming language I wrote a grammar for it and used a parser generator PEGjs to generate the parser That works perfectly except for one thing macros that replace a placeholder with predefined text I don t know how to integrate this into a grammar Let me illustrate the problem An example program to be parsed typically looks like this instructionA parameter1 parameter2instructionB parameter1instructionC parameter1 parameter2 parameter3No problem so far But the language also supports macros Define MacroX foo bar instructionD parameter1 MacroX parameter4Define MacroY macroParameter1 macroParameter2 instructionE parameter1 macroParameter1 instructionF macroParameter2 MacroX instructionG parameter1 MacroXMacroYOf course I could define a grammar to identify Macros and references to Macros But in that case I don t know how I would parse the contents of a Macro because it s not clear what the macro contains It could be just one parameter that s easiest but it could also be several parameters in one macro like MacroX in my example which represents two parameters or a whole block of instructions like MacroY And Macros can even contain other Macros How do I put this into a grammar if it s not clear what the macro is semantically The easiest approach seems to be to run a preprocessor first to replace all the macros and only then run the parser But in that case the line numbers get messed up I want the parser to generate error messages containing the line number if there is a parse error And if I preprocess the input the line numbers do not correspond anymore Help very much appreciated,yacc

Scenario We have both Winforms and MVC code that is being used to work on a nation wide multi user platform that does lots of logistics for lots of users Tax rules change per state and even per city or county These tax rules make a huge difference for our industry The other issue is that rules can change based on legislation The system will have to handle cases where before a date it works one way and then different after that date This changeover will need to be entered into the system and tested before that date comes Proposed Solution Use Workflow Foundation to create a time based system where our users can change and add rules that change the way taxes are calculated Question I have not used Workflow Foundation and searching has returned books to look at but not a lot of examples of people using this technology successfully Is my scenario a good use of Workflow Foundation I think so If you have any experience with Workflow Foundation any tips on making this work well,engine
When you are faced with a user client who isn t a computer expert and in fact is very much a novice who would benefit from some basic how to compute guidance what books or sites do you direct them to A quick look at the Windows for Dummies style of books on Amazon seems to be focused on the home user That is there are chapters dedicated to things like how to install windows how to backup files make videos from your home movies etc These topics don t apply to small biz office users and might scare away someone who just wants to learn things like you can press ctrl c to copy ctrl v to paste Far more useful topics would be things like keyboard shortcuts using web based tools like GMail and Google Docs how to create a PDF how do scan a document etc Stuff that would benefit any novice user in an SMB,business

First things first I have been struggling while dealing with raw CSS to generate complex page layouts It gets further complicated with browser vendors looking in different directions Well now that can t be changed So after a lot of efforts I started looking for A WYSIWYG editor that would take in content and allow me to define the desired layout and magically generate CSS that would honor most of the latest browsers while also taking into account the liquid amp fluid attributes of the layout jQuery plugin that would take care of content arrangement complexity while just taking in inputs for the desired layout I haven t been able to find anything for the first quest I d like to know if there is any such WYSIWYG editor out there There are many CSS editors but they don t abstract the raw CSS One needs to know CSS thoroughly and that IMHO beats the need of such an editor Notepad or a regular IDE is good enough For the second point I came across this thread on stackoverflow Now this put me in a problem of abundance not a bad thing BTW This post has links to several jQuery plugins that do the trick Some of them are jQuery UI Layout Plug in jLayout jQuery PluginDocking Layout ManagerI am looking for comments and recommendations from people who may have used 1 or more of these Plugin s simplicity is important and equally important is the flexibility plugin shouldn t be restrictive Frankly I d like to offload much of the CSS job to a tool,jquery

Does anyone know of an web log analyser that can both report on the processing time field that Apache can store D and also parse querystrings intelligently I ve looked into some of the usual suspects eg AWStats and Webalyser but none I ve looked at seem to offer either of these features Ideally you d be able to report on specific querystring parameters rather than simple page requests eg if my server showed hits to someurl blah X amp whatever Y someurl whatever Y amp blah ZI d like it to be able to parse that intelligently so if I ask for a report where whatever Y both URLs would be grouped together whereas if I report on blah X they would be counted separately Any suggestions of off the shelf tools that can do this FOSS or otherwise Yes I realise that I can write some awk or sed scripts to parse this sort of thing myself but I m looking for someone to have done that hard work for me and present it in a nice chart or what have you,web

I am having an issue where jQuery InArray is returning 1 when I run a function but I know that the values that I m testing for are definitely in the array I know that they are in the array because if I console log the values of the array right before I run jQuery inArray the values exist and display Here is an example of what I m working with In page php images 8 13 21 32 40 56 In script js console log images gt images output images gt 8 13 21 32 40 56 var testingValue 13 console log inArray gt jQuery inArray testingValue images Should return 1 output inArray gt 1console log inArray gt jQuery inArray 13 images Should return 1 output inArray gt 1console log inArray gt jQuery inArray 13 images Should return 1 output inArray gt 1console log inArray gt jQuery inArray 13 images Should return 1 output inArray gt 1All of these return 1 even though the top two should return 1 The weird thing is that if I manually test for jQuery inArray testingValue images in the console I do get the value 1 One thing to note The variable images is created in the php page that the js file is included in This shouldn t be an issue Additional note Yes jQuery is included well before this part of the script runs Many other jQuery functions are running successfully before this one What I am wondering is if there are any gotchas to this function I have used it successfully in the past and can t see anything with my code which would prevent this from returning a proper value,inarray

I have a PowerEdge server that has 1 management NIC and 4 other NICs I have the management NIC set up so that I can access iDRAC and it works great Now I d like to set up Windows 2008 R2 Hyper V Our network has two kinds of IP addresses One is the 10 10 x x kind that you can t get to from outside the network The other is a public kind like 128 210 x x I thought I should set up one NIC with a 10 10 x x IP address and the other with as 128 210 x x IP address so that the Hyper V parent partition can use the 10 10 x x one and be relatively safe from outside attack Then the child partitions guest OS s running on top of Hyper V could use the public NIC so that people could get at them from anywhere some of these are web servers When I try to set them up this way Windows complains about having multiple default gateways If I give both NICs public IPs then things work that is both parent and child partitions can get out to the internet Could someone who knows vastly more about networking than me explain what I should be doing here The basic idea is to have one VM running a file server accessible on a 10 10 x x IP or via WINS like FILESERVER and then to have a bunch of other VMs that are separate webservers Thanks,2008

I am using svn for version control and want to be able to compare 2 revisions of a MS Word doc side by side I am aware of Araxis Merge but this converts the doc to text and compares which is more clever than I need it to be I would like a tool that would allow me to visually compare the files preserving the formatting images etc that may be present in the doc I know MS Word has a compare docs feature using track changes but this requires 2 copies of the document to be present on your drive I want to directly compare revisions in the svn repository db without having to revert my local copy change the filename and then compare to another working copy Is there any tool free or commercial that can do this,diff

My app has a feature that when enabled presents a â decoyâ screen whenever the app is launched The user then has to tap in a â secret knockâ to dismiss the decoy screen and see the password screen The problem is when the app is launched a split second before the decoy screen is presented the screen that was active before the app was suspended is shown Itâ s shown for just a split second but depending on what the user was previously doing it can be awkward Anyway this little â glitchâ practically defeats the whole purpose of the decoy screen The app is a free download so if you have an iOS device please download the app and activate the decoy feature on the options screen to see what Iâ m trying to say here And finally to the question Is there a way to not have the app present the last active screen when itâ s launched I want the decoy screen to be the first thing to come up whenever the app is launched without that split second of the previous content I know I can set the UIApplicationExitsOnSuspend to YES on the plist file to work around the problem But that would force the app to quit and not suspend I would really like to keep the suspend feature working Hope I made it clear enough,relaunch
I was wondering what s the best practice concerning EF and foreign keys in a relational database I don t really know how to explain my situation clearly so here s an example In the database I have 2 tables Event amp Project An Event has a Project so one of the columns in the table Event is a foreign key pointing to the ID of a project let s say its an int The code generated by EF for the Event entity references this foreign key by a projectId propertyWhen mapping the EF model to my business model I don t make the conversion between the projectId and the corresponding Project object I keep it as the projectId property My concern is regarding 3 Should I make this conversion in my business model Won t I be bothered with performances later if I have a lot of this mapping to do during runtime Or maybe I missed did something wrong in an earlier step Hope you guys understood my problem and can help me understand better how I should have proceeded and why,entity

I have a server with multiple NICs on it Each NIC is plugged into a different isolated network that is serving multicast traffic I have a program that listens to the multicast traffic on each of these networks Right now I have to specify in my program which interface to use as part of the multicast join This is not a big deal but is slightly inconvenient Is it possible to use routes to influence this process Suppose I have two multicast groups as follows A 224 1 2 32 39312 eth1B 224 1 11 19 59328 eth2Can I add two routes to the routing table such that when I join the multicast group from my code the kernel knows to send group A s join out eth1 and group B s join out eth2 I ve been unable to get it to behave the way I want Adding various routes seems to not affect this process and the only way I ve found to be able to influence which interface is chosen is to specify it in code as part of the multicast_request data structure,multicast

For a large table of transactions 100 million rows 20 GB that already has a primary key a natural composite key of 4 columns will it help performance to add an identity column and make that the primary key The current primary key the natural composite primary key of 4 columns does the job but I have been told that you should always have a surrogate key So could improve performance by creating an identity column and making that the primary key I m using SQL Server 2008 R2 database EDIT This transaction table is mainly joined to definition tables and used to populate reports EDIT If I did add a surrogate key it wouldn t be used in any joins The existing key fields would be used EDIT There would be no child tables to this table,server

I am trying to do some very simple and crude graphics stuff with Java deliberately crude and simple as it emulates a computing environment from 1980 1981 The Java Groovy in fact code runs some very simple BASIC 10 REM Testing Plotting20 FOR X 0 TO 3130 LET Y SIN X 10 40 PLOT X 11 Y 11 50 NEXT XPlot is provided in Java Groovy like this grafix textArea getGraphics def plot def x def y grafix fillRect x 20 as Integer y 20 as Integer 20 20 Now the code works after a fashion I briefly see a sine curve flash on the screen but it disappears almost instantaneously presumably on next repaint of the text area How can I get the graphics to stay there the only way I can think of is to save the plots and unplots into a list and then have that play every paint but that seems quite an extreme solution,basic

I have finally got this thing I ve tried about 12 times to make and 12 different ways but finally got it to work sort of I made a custom metabox for uploading and attaching images to posts and it doesn t require you to use the horrible thickbox media uploader built into WP I hate that thing No what I ve done is just a group of inputs title description file which you can also duplicate to add additional attachments if you want So you fill in the fields select an image to upload and save draft or publish the post Once there are attachments added to a post the metabox will display the input fields along with a preview image of the attached image for each attachment you added The title and description fields are used to generate the file meta data nothing is saved as the post_meta that I know of That s currently all that I have gotten working so far I need to make it so that when you save publish a post inturn upload create the attachment files it will create the three image sizes as the default wp uploader would thumbnail medium large and keeping the full size image too If that s possible somehow If not I would like to otherwise use add_image_size to create define new custom sizes and generate them that way instead upon uploading I m not sure which function is the most ideal to use in this case maybe the image_make_intermediate_size function would be better or wp_create_thumbnail or wp_crop_image who knows I cannot figure out how to go about doing that if I need to run the wp_handle_upload function for each one or maybe something involving the wp_generate_attachment_metadata function It s confusing to me since the 3 image sizes are to be associated as variants of the same attachment and how to go about doing that I have scoured the web read the source of every wp media upload image related file and played with just about every function there is for the media upload stuff and cannot find how WP creates the 3 image sizes anywhere or how to do it myself In wp includes media php the image_resize function looks like it would be best since it s exactly what it should be I just can t figure out for the life of me what the hell I m missing or have tried doing but did wrong to make the image thumbnails Here s my working function that does the wp_handle_upload stuff and things but it also needs to create the 100px thumb and make a resize version of the image that is max width like 500px and saved as new files of the uploaded one function update_attachment global post wp_update_attachment_metadata post gt ID _POST a_image if empty _FILES a_image name New upload require_once ABSPATH wp admin includes file php override action editpost url wp_handle_upload _FILES a_image override medium image_make_intermediate_size uploaded_file url 500 400 true thumb image_make_intermediate_size uploaded_file url 100 100 true if isset file error return new WP_Error upload_error file error array_type wp_check_filetype allowed_file_types array image jpg image jpeg image gif image png name_parts pathinfo name name trim substr name 0 1 strlen name_parts extension type file type file file file title _POST a_title _POST a_title name content _POST a_desc post_id post gt ID attachment array post_title gt title post_type gt attachment post_content gt content post_parent gt post_id post_mime_type gt type guid gt url url Save the data id wp_insert_attachment attachment _FILES a_image file post_id for post_thumbnails if is_wp_error id attach_meta wp_generate_attachment_metadata id uploaded_file url wp_update_attachment_metadata attach_id attach_meta update_post_meta post gt ID a_image uploaded_file url Anyone able to help me finally fix this so it works proper would be loved I ve spent so many ridiculous countless hours numerous different times trying to develop this thing and the documentation sucks and there s not really any good posts anywhere on how to do it Thanks,size

Okay I ve got a site set up which has some APIs we expose to developers which are in the format api item xml type_ids 34 35 37 amp region_ids 1000002 1000003 amp key SOMERANDOMALPHANUMIn this URI type_ids is always set region_ids and key are optional The important thing to note is that the key variable does not affect the content of the response It is used for internal tracking of requests so we can identify people who make slow or otherwise unwanted requests In Varnish we have a VCL like this if req http host the site in question com if req url api xml unset req http cookie We just strip cookies out and let the backend do the rest as far as times are concerned this is a hackaround since Rails authlogic sends session cookies with API responses At present though any distinct developers are basically hitting different caches since amp key SOMEALPHANUM is considered as part of the Varnish hash for storage This is obviously not a great solution and I m trying to work out how to tell Varnish to ignore that part of the URI,on

I am a complete starter in web development as I know only basics of HTML and CSS although I have a history of desktop development What is the usual roadmap to get started in web apps based on AJAX We decided to use Dojo toolkit as our javascript library Is the following a feasible map 1 Learn basic javascript already on it 2 Learn what DOM is3 Start with Dojo documentation and examples4 Get into AJAX with DojoAddendum My goal is not to become a professional web developer who builds public web pages it is not my specialty I am trying to build an interface to an embedded product my company develops We chose dojo mostly because it provides widgets for easy interface development I am just trying to find out the easiest way to get this done I got several satisfactory answers and have difficulty choosing the best,ajax
Horrible at proofs would love some help getting into better form Please and thank you all Critiques welcome 1st question Let a and b be positive integers and we write the result of the division algorithm a bq r where q and r are integers with 0 leq r lt b For each of the following statements decide if it is true or false If true give a short proof If false give an explicit counter example gcd a b gcd b r Let gcd a b d_1 Then d_1 divides the set ax by mid x y in Bbb Z as it is the definition of gcd a bq r as given by the question so d_1 divides bq and r Since r a bq we can let a dc where d is the gcd a d thus b c3d thus d divides r Let the gcd b r d_2 since a and b are positive and we know bq geq b for all q Therefore d_2 divides d_1 Next since d_1 mid b and d_1 mid r d_1 must divide gcd b r d_2 Therefore d_1 mid d_2 Since d_1 mid d_2 and d_2 mid d_1 then d_1 d_2 Alright this next one is probably just plain wrong but here goes Let a and b be integers and let n be a positive integer Prove that the equation ax equiv b pmod n has a solution if and only if a n divides b The point here is that we do not assume a n 1 So what I did was Let d gcd a n Then d mid a by common sense so a dq_1 where q_1 is an integer Which leads to dq_1 x is congruent to b where q_1 and x are integers d mid dq_1x which is the left hand side of the equation thus it must also divide the right hand sideThus d mid b Which leads to if gcd a n does not divide b there is no solution to the congruence Which is one if Other direction is d mid b then b dw where w is an integer Then d mid ax or d mid dq_1x Thus we have a system q_1x is congruent to w where x q_1 and w are integers and gcd q_1 n 1 So we apply the theorem in my text book that says a solution exists when that happens,number

When you need to initialize a static variable in Java you can do something like that public class MyClass private static Object someStaticObject static initialize someStaticObject here How can you do the same in Cocoa Specifically here is what I am after I have an app with a large number of user preferences I would like to manage all these preferences from one class where all methods are static as follows implementation Preferences void setMotion BOOL isMotion NSUserDefaults standardUserDefaults setBool isMotion forKey keyIsMotion NSUserDefaults standardUserDefaults synchronize BOOL isMotion NSUserDefaults standardUserDefaults boolForKey keyIsMotion So that I can access and set my preference easily anywhere in my code with Preferences setMotion TRUE or if Preferences isMotion Given that I plan to have tens of static methods it would like to have a static variable defaults defined as follows NSUserDefaults defaults NSUserDefaults standardUserDefaults so that my code above could become void setMotion BOOL isMotion defaults setBool isMotion forKey keyIsMotion defaults synchronize BOOL isMotion defaults boolForKey keyIsMotion However I am not sure how to accomplish that,static

The setup is pretty simple and I have it working through a VPN already but extremely slow and probably not the best idea Both systems have a large directory full of documents used with a SQL database One runs on Server 2008 R1 one on 2008 R2 When we switched to 2008 R2 we had a lot of people who found they could no longer connect to mapped drives which is what the folders were Rather than going backward to R1 all the way I figured this would be a good time to make the files accessible through two routes for a fall back in case of connection problems But for this to work both directories have to be in sync at all times There are plenty of programs to do that and I could leave the two servers connected via VPN for the sync But I have never tried that before and I just wondered if any one knew if I am about to cause a problem by creating some kind of Loop The two systems are on different routers and different IP networks and access the Internet through different services one is T1 one is cable Outside people have begun to use ONLY the older 2008 R1 as their VPN connection is 100 almost all the time The R2 got better with time but still has issues occasionally and besides I have to map the drive letter to a single IP While I could wrap the whole mapping thing up into the VPN where if they connect to VPN1 it maps access to IP 1 and VPN2 maps access to IP 2 This still doesn t solve my problem of keeping them in sync Having a fully synchronized and working backup system would be nice to have If I could be sure of my methodsThanksPS I almost forgot What I am trying to find is a way to connect these two just for synchronizing I wondered if using a 2nd Network card in each that would only carry the traffic for the sync Or would that interfere with the primary NIC,server

I have a basic gridview with paging enabled I have 11 rows in my database and the gridview s page size is 10 When I come to the page it shows 10 rows and in my pager it shows me on page one with a link to a second page When I click on the second page it refreshes the page and goes to page 2 and displays the 11th lonely row When I put an update panel around it however it drops the last row When I come to the page it shows the same as without the update panel It shows 10 rows with page 1 and 2 on the pager When I click on page 2 however it does it s ajax thing but doesn t display the last record on the 2nd page Then if I go from page 2 back to page 1 it only displays 9 rows instead of the 10 it used to display For some reason when I have an update panel around my gridview after you page once it never displays the last row I have tried all the different combinations of RenderMode ChildrenAsTriggers and UpdateMode to no avail I also have a form on the page that allows you to add new rows to the database and consequently the gridview as well as an edit and delete link inside the gridview all within the update panel When I add a new row via the form or edit delete this doesn t happen it only happens when I page Any ideas why the gridview won t display the last record row after I page only when it s inside an update panel Here is the code ASPX lt asp UpdatePanel runat server

So originally I had a structure like this in my video view lt video comment_titles each do comment_title gt lt comment_title title gt lt comment_title comments each do comment gt lt comment body gt lt end gt lt end gt and this worked fine because when a user added a comment they picked a comment title that it would be added under and then all the comments belonging to a title would be added to that title However I now want to place the comments into a partial so I did something like this lt video comment_titles each do comment_title gt lt comment_title title gt lt comment_title comments each do comment gt lt render video comments gt lt end gt lt end gt and i put all of the comment generation into comments _comment html erbHowever this does not add the comments as I intend them to be added Comments are added under all comment titles even if they only belong to one comment title So my question is how can I move the creation of comments to a partial in the comments directory while keeping my visual structure the same,ruby

Iâ m playing around with a little VB NET app with WPf MVVM and ADO NET EF on a SQL Express DB and Iâ m running into problems while trying to update related objects My DB has three tables â tb_Actorsâ â tb_Moviesâ and a junction table â tb_movies_actorsâ The EF designer creates two entities Actors und Movies and sets their navigation properties based on the foreign keys correctly So was able to come up with a view which binds to a viewModels property which has all â Movies Actorsâ The DataGrid in my view displays all actors correctly and â if itâ s a new actor which isnâ t in my DB already I am able to add new actors to a movie and persist the changes to the DB correctly However if I want to add an actor to a movie who is already in my DB Iâ ll get a double entry in my tb_actors table First Iâ ve set the primary key fields name and id to UNIQUE but then my code breaks Then Iâ ve added a little update routine which checks for each related actor of a movie if itâ s a known actor and changes the â new actorsâ id to the â old actorsâ id â this also breaks Is there a way to tell EF that it has to determine if an added related object already known actor added to movie is already in the DB and it therefore has to insert only a new entry to to junction table but not to the related objects table My next step would be detaching the related objects and do all updates inserts in my own data access code â but since I believe my problem is around a typical EF use case there must be a more elegant way to deal with updates on related objects Any thoughts answers hints are highly appreciated EDIT Here are the relevant code snippets 1 I have the following LoadMovies Function in my MovieRepository data access class Private Function LoadMovies As List Of Movies movs From m In dc Movies Include Actors Select m Return movs ToListEnd Function2 The following property of my viewModel exposes the actors related to a specific movie Public ReadOnly Property actors As ICollectionView Get If evs Is Nothing Then evs New CollectionViewSource evs Source _movie Actors End If Return evs View End Get End Property3 In my MovieDetail view I ve a datagrid binding to the property lt DataGrid Name ActTestGrid HorizontalAlignment Left VerticalAlignment Stretch ItemsSource Binding actors AutoGenerateColumns False Width 150 Height 120 Style StaticResource dgTemplate RowStyle StaticResource dgRowTemplate CellStyle StaticResource dgCellTemplate CanUserSortColumns True CanUserAddRows True CanUserDeleteRows True HeadersVisibility None gt lt DataGrid Columns gt lt DataGridTextColumn Header Name Binding Binding Path name UpdateSourceTrigger PropertyChanged CanUserSort true gt lt DataGrid Columns gt lt DataGrid gt 4 This is my updateMovie Function of my MovieRepository as by now Public Sub UpdateMovie ByVal movie As Movies If movie Is Nothing Then Throw New ArgumentNullException Movie Else dc SaveChanges End IfEnd Sub,net

What is the best way to determine whether or not a field s value is an integer in SQL Server 2000 2005 2008 IsNumeric returns true for a variety of formats that would not likely convert to an integer Examples include 15 000 and 15 1 You can use a like statement but that only appears to work well for fields that have a pre determined number of digits select where zipcode like 0 9 0 9 0 9 0 9 0 9 I could write a user defined function that attempts to convert a varchar parameter to an int within a try catch block but I m checking with the community to see if someone has come across any succient methods to achieve this goal preferably one that can be used within the where clause of a SQL statement without creating other objects,tsql

Q1 FormsAuthentication CookieDomain property specifies the domain for which this cookie is valid Overriding this property is useful if you want to enable the cookie to be used for more applications on your web serverA I assume the quote is suggesting that if same browser is used to log onto two web applications then overriding this property will cause these two applications to put their tickets into same authentication cookie B Doesnâ t above quote imply that if we only have one Asp Net application running on our web server then we donâ t need to overwrite the default value which is an empty string But as far as I know even if we only have one Asp Net application running on our web server we would still need to set this property to a value representing our domain else forms authentication would not work,cookies
Finding the longest path in a graph is intractable problem The decision version is NP complete However Given a graph Is there an efficient algorithm to determine the parity of the longest path in a graph The algorithm should output YES if the length of the longest path is even otherwise the output is NO Also What is the complexity if we restrict the input to cubic graphs EDIT 1 I moved some of my comments here as requested by a friend My problem is LPEP graph G the longest path in G has even length The answer of Gadi A proves intractability and I accepted it I was waiting for Karp reduction Cross posted on Math StackExchange,algorithms

Is it true that for all proofs forall x exists y R x y then y y x A while back I remember reading a book on functional programming that was leading into some questions about what exactly mathematical proofs were and how they were related to functions In fact I just found the book link to PDF page 16 marked page 3 The author mentions that if we have a proof that forall x exists y R x y then in a sense because x is bound before y then y is dependent on x and therefore y y x There may be counterexamples Perhaps y is a constant itself but then y x can also just be a constant function I m trying to understand under what circumstances this is not true Example Let f mathbb R n to mathbb R be continuous at a point vec v_0 and f vec v_0 A lt 0 Prove that there exists a number delta gt 0 such that if vec v vec v_0 lt delta then f vec v lt 0 My argument was simply to use the statement of continuity at vec v_0 to prove this That is since f is continuous the following holds forall epsilon gt 0 quad exists delta gt 0 quad vec v vec v_0 lt delta Rightarrow f vec v f vec v_0 lt epsilon So as referred to above we must have delta delta epsilon Then we can make the replacement delta delta A and we have the necessary delta to prove that f vec v lt 0 I have one main question the one that closes this and one side question Under what conditions can we assume that forall x exists y R x y then y y x Are there indirect ways to prove a proposition of the form forall x exists y R x y where y is somehow not dependent on x and also not a constant Perhaps it varies on R but that is given I suppose Certainly all epsilon delta proofs that I ve come across have been constructive in this way Is there a canonical way to prove the proposition above I actually struggled with a possible proof for a while before I came up with the technique above I used this technique in a HW assignment and on my latest Advanced Calculus test The HW was marked as correct although with the note that it was indirect while the test was marked as wrong Granted the HW was done by the TA the test by my prof I personally don t see a more direct way to prove this result,logic
Assume I have a funny video site that shows funny videos to users Below every video I want to have a statement that says 5 seconds ago 31 minutes ago Yesterday 2 days ago based on a timestamp of the video and the current time The timestamp that I have is in the format 2011 10 17 07 08 00 I m not too good with dates but I m guessing that I need to find the difference between the 2 date time in seconds then decide if its between 0sec amp 60sec to display in seconds or between 60sec amp 3600sec to display in minutes or between 3600sec amp 3600x24sec to display in hours between 3600x24sec amp 3600x24x2sec to display yesterday and so on I believe I should be using strtotime but I cant seem to find the current time as those solutions I found used new date which does not seem to work How can I do this Btw side question when I insert 2011 10 17 7 08PM EDT into a MySQL timestamp column it gets converted to 2011 10 17 07 08 00 which is AM How can I get it to be stored in the correct AM PM,date

I have a form with 3 option buttons and about 50 labels textboxes and buttons Is there a way I can group some of these objects so that way when I select an option some of the objects get disabled or enabled and I only have to use vba to say which group is enabled or disabled Or will I have to write vba for each object and have 1000 lines of code,access
I have a json object array I want to search the array and for each object create a list of services that is a comma seperated list of all the keys which have a value of yes The list of json objects with the services list is then displayed in html using jquery s each Its a large json file so I want to do it as efficiently as possible I already have the object s properties being accessed through jQuery s each ie obj name so I think it should be possible to filter the services listed for each object using jQuery s filter and then display the key if the value is yes But it seems like a more efficient option would probably be to create a new javascript array join the services with a value of yes and then add that variable to the html being appended Im not sure which would be faster and so far havent been very successful at either so any advice and examples would be very helpful Here s what the json array looks like name name1 service1 y service2 y service3 n name name2 service1 n service2 y service3 n,filter

So I have an old computer functioning as an OpenBSD router for my home network I had 3 network cards one to wired home network one to wireless network and one to my modem One day pings magically stopped working I login to the router with ssh over my wired network everything appears fine dhclient is still getting an address from the modem and everything but ping 8 8 8 8 doesn t work I double and triple checked my configuration for 2 days trying to figure out why Finally I decide to try putting in another network card I put it in and change everything from fxp0 to rl2 and everything magically works again Now fast forward to today Today my power went out from a thunderstorm I had both my main computer for some reason forgot to change it over and router plugged into the modem After the power came back on and the storm passed I powered the two machines back up I could get internet on my computer plugged into the modem but not on my router Once again dhcp works fine but ping fails It appears that another network card got fried I would blame the modem but why didn t my home computer s network card also get fried How can I prevent another one from getting fried Also is there anyway to tell if the network card is actually fried,modem
I am using a Zebra LP 2844 to print barcode labels out of the Chrome browser as it has good printing support for this purpose The one problem that I cannot seem to solve is that the paper size is never maintained after a label has printed This is true of other applications as well and seems to be an issue with the OS Even if the presets are saved the paper size always defaults back to US Letter or in the case of the machine in question Other I have looked at the plist for that printer as well as the printing plist and the default paper size is set to the one I created for the Zebra However as soon as that paper size is selected in the print dialog and the document prints the next time it prints the paper size is back to default Does anyone know how to defeat this I have repaired permissions deleted plists etc Thanks so much,snow

Is there some plugin or tool which can read a h file or simply modify Intellisense itself and spit out every function and it s virtual function table index There s a pattern which I have yet to figure out having to do with polymorphism and it gets 5x harder when you start to have 5 classes or more deriving from each other No matter what though the MSVC compiler always spits out the correct virtual function table index when it compiles the virtual function call from C to Assembly There has to be a better way to get that index without loading break pointing reading the offset and rewriting the code right Thanks,functions

I have a list that uses a database to display some data There are several operations that the user can perform on each list item and instead of implementing a context menu where the user uses a long press to bring up a list of possible operations I would like to add buttons to each item so the user can just tap the button and perform the operation The list can be potentially large and attaching a listener to each button for each list item is overkill so I would like to do what Javascript programmers do with event bubbling i e attach a single handler to a top level element like the entire list and let the click events bubble up to it How would I go about doing this,event
I have used my hosts file located in private etc hosts several months to block distracting websites during the work day This worked all well until now Today it suddenly stopped working Some sample lines from the hosts file 127 0 0 1 facebook com 127 0 0 1 www facebook comI placed that text in the hosts file by the following steps sudo nano etc hosts wrote the lines above then O to write the file Enter to confirm the filename and X to exit the editor Between the localhost IP and the domain name I have a tab The line endings are Unix style LF and the weird part is that when I use the ping command it seems to do its job properly ping facebook com PING facebook com 127 0 0 1 56 data bytes 64 bytes from 127 0 0 1 icmp_seq 0 ttl 64 time 0 137 ms 64 bytes from 127 0 0 1 icmp_seq 1 ttl 64 time 0 122 ms 64 bytes from 127 0 0 1 icmp_seq 2 ttl 64 time 0 118 ms 64 bytes from 127 0 0 1 icmp_seq 3 ttl 64 time 0 110 ms C facebook com ping statistics 4 packets transmitted 4 packets received 0 0 packet loss round trip min avg max stddev 0 110 0 122 0 137 0 010 ms But when I try to access facebook com in Safari or Firefox I am still able to get to the web site This is also the case for other website that I have blocked in a similar way I have emptied the cache for both browsers but this didn t solve the problem What can I do to solve this problem Update 1 I m now checking all the websites I ve blocked this way and found out that the behaviour is not consistent across different domains These are the time waster I m blocking in private etc hosts Block time killers 127 0 0 1 9gag com 127 0 0 1 flabber nl 127 0 0 1 geenstijl nl 127 0 0 1 dumpert nl 127 0 0 1 facebook com 127 0 0 1 www 9gag com 127 0 0 1 www flabber nl 127 0 0 1 www geenstijl nl 127 0 0 1 www dumpert nl 127 0 0 1 www facebook com All sites from this list ping to 127 0 0 1 however 9gag com and flabber nl are unreachable by any browser but geenstijl nl dumpert nl and facebook com are reachable I have tried restarting this did not solve the problem Before this problem I have not changed the system configuration by an update of some sort Update 2 Three hours ago I could access facebook com through Safari and Firefox now I can t anymore geenstijl nl and dumpert nl are still accessible though I haven t changed anything in the past three hours just used Word and browsed the web with Safari Update 3 Now four hours after the 2nd update the hosts file works as normal again In the process off fumbling with the hosts file I removed the non working entries and re added them one by one testing each one after it was added I have no idea what was happening and can t run wireshark on the traffic anymore as there is no faulty behaviour I can observe Update 4 And the problem is back again The same sites as in update 1 show the erroneous behaviour,hosts

I am building an AJAX deep linked site I want PHP to load all the HTML code of the page if the user is trying to access the site with a javascript non supported browser or if it is a search crawler Basically PHP will return the whole page Contrary when the user is trying to access the site with javascript supported browser I want PHP to return only the template code and let javascript AJAX take care of the rest Basically PHP will only load design elements and let Javascript populate them with content I looked into PHP s get_browser function however it seems it is not such a reliable tool What is the industry s practice see if the browser supports Javascript or it is a search crawler using PHP Background Why I want the site to have this behavior Since I want the home page to load just by loading the address example com which does not send any query to PHP PHP returns the HTML code of the home page This however causes issues when the user tries to load the following page example com foo So for this example PHP will return home page and once the home page is loaded javascipt AJAX will change the content around so that it shows proper content for foo This will make the user to see the home page therefore load time will be slower and user experience will not be so nice However if my PHP script can figure out that if the use with javascipt supported browser is trying to load the page it will only return the template of the web site which has no content and the javascript will populate that template with content whatever is supposed to be displayed for foo On the other hand if the javascipt non sepported browser or a crawler will try to access the page example com foo home page will be returned I am using SWFaddress http www asual com swfaddress library for the deep linking Thank you in advance EditThank you guys I did not think of using lt noscript gt lt noscript gt before Here is what I decided to do PHP by default will load pages such as example com or example com foo which is essentially the same as example com from PHP s point of view since fragments by definition are not sent to the server blank just visual template with lt noscript gt tag inside for the content of the home page This way users with javascript will not see the home page and AJAX will populate the content of the page according to the foo fragment On the other hand search crawlers and users without javascript will see a home page Thank you again I think this is pretty simple and elegant solution If you have any further suggestions please post a comment or another answer,linking

I m struggling with the value of knowledge between JavaScript base functionality and JavaScript libraries While I understand the underlying concepts used by many of today s popular libraries JQuery as an example ajax animate etc I find that the more I rely upon these libraries the less and less I actually know about JavaScript on its own I m wondering how much other people handle this disparity do you intentionally ignore libraries at times in order to maintain skills in straight JavaScript Rest happily knowing that the function calls you made with your library of choice will work on a wide variety of browsers without the headache etc I find that under time constraints in many cases there isn t even time to use anything but a simplified library because the testing and sheer size of code would eclipse the time allotted to JavaScript functionality Anyway what do people think Edit Since it seems to be a bit unclear I bet the title is at fault here I m not trying to argue for or against either point of view just stating the fact that I do lose a bit of one when I gain a bit of the other By no means do I find the use of a library bad I just wanted to see how people cope with the shift of knowledge or if it s even necessary to cope Thanks for all the input so far,library

One thing that bugs me about IE is that when it goes to load a page with an iframe it will wait until the iframe has finished loading before it will render the page Firefox by contrast will render all the other page elements while the iframe is loading which is really nice if the iframe takes a long time to load because it gives the user some feedback that the page is progressing It also allows you to do things like display a iframe loading messege while the frame loads and swap it out onload of the iframe So I am wondering if anyone has found a workaround for this Ideally I d like to see a cross browser solution that shows a progess bar as an iframe loads on the page Short of that I d take a method of implementing an iframe that forces IE to first render the page then load the iframe I have seen a couple of interesting jquery progress bars like http plugins jquery com project jQueryProgressBarBut and correct me if I m wrong here cause my understanding is shaky it seems to me the jquery bars only render after the DOM has loaded In IE the iframe content is not shown until after the DOM is loaded so showing a progress bar at that point is irrelevant I ve also tried setting the iframe src to loading htm and then onload switch the src to the content I want Sadly IE still will not render the page until the final content page comes up seems strange to me Help me stackoverflow you re my only hope,progress

Sorry if title isn t exactly what my question is asking I m a bit unsure the best way to ask this Basically I ve created a DirectX C application which of course utilizes the Win32 functions So I have the static method belowstatic LRESULT CALLBACK WindowProc HWND hWnd UINT message WPARAM wParam LPARAM lParam The method above has the following case statement within it case WM_INPUT unsigned __int32 dwSize GetRawInputData HRAWINPUT__ lParam RID_INPUT NULL amp dwSize sizeof RAWINPUTHEADER unsigned char lpb new unsigned char dwSize GetRawInputData HRAWINPUT__ lParam RID_INPUT lpb amp dwSize sizeof RAWINPUTHEADER tagRAWINPUT raw tagRAWINPUT lpb InputSystem handleRawMessage raw delete lpb break Alright then the method InputSystem handleRawMessage raw does the below __int32 KEY_STATE 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 void InputSystem handleRawMessage tagRAWINPUT raw if raw gt header dwType RIM_TYPEKEYBOARD int key raw gt data keyboard VKey amp 0xFF KEY_STATE key gt gt 5 1 lt lt key amp 0x1F So I m assuming the WindowProc is a separate thread so I m making it access these arrays and store values to them Well here s were I feel a problem might occur but I m not sure if this is safe or not since only 1 method reads and 1 method writes void InputSystem handleInput void PREVIOUS_STATE CURRENT_STATE CURRENT_STATE 0 for int i 0 i lt MAPPING_SIZE i if isKeyPressed MAPPED_KEYS i CURRENT_STATE 1 lt lt i if PREVIOUS_STATE amp 1 lt lt 0x10 i CURRENT_STATE 1 lt lt 0x10 i clearKeyStates bool InputSystem isKeyPressed unsigned __int8 key return KEY_STATE key gt gt 5 amp 1 lt lt key amp 0x1F 0x0 The above code InputSystem handleInput is called within the while loop that is started in order to continue drawing DirectX Graphics So is the above code safe execution or will I run into problems when both threads are performing something on the same value I m fairly new to anything dealing with Win32 and I ve only recently gotten into DirectX not that DirectX has really anything to do with this I ve never truly had the need to worry too much about concurrency so I never did but I d like to understand this particular situation along with other situations where it s safe and not safe if possible Thanks The while loop is generated from the below code int WINAPI WinMain HINSTANCE hInstance HINSTANCE hPrevInstance LPSTR lpCmdLine int nCmdShow Dx3DEngine engine Dx3DEngine hInstance hPrevInstance lpCmdLine nCmdShow int code engine run if code 0 engine createUnsupportedWindow code return code int Dx3DEngine run MSG msg msg message WM_NULL __int64 cntsPerSec 0 __int64 prevTimeStamp 0 __int64 currTimeStamp 0 QueryPerformanceFrequency LARGE_INTEGER amp cntsPerSec QueryPerformanceCounter LARGE_INTEGER amp prevTimeStamp const float secsPerCnt 1 0F float cntsPerSec while msg message WM_QUIT while PeekMessage amp msg NULL 0 0 PM_REMOVE TranslateMessage amp msg DispatchMessage amp msg QueryPerformanceCounter LARGE_INTEGER amp currTimeStamp float dt currTimeStamp prevTimeStamp secsPerCnt update dt draw prevTimeStamp currTimeStamp clean return int msg wParam,safety

I tried to learn Dvorak keyboard layout a few years ago and got reasonably good at it but I couldn t get past the fact that command key shortcuts were no longer in the right place In particular Ctrl Z undo Ctrl X cut Ctrl C copy and Ctrl V paste are all chosen specifically because of the location of those keys on a Qwerty keyboard well maybe Ctrl C makes sense Ctrl A select all and Ctrl S save are also very convenient because of their Qwerty keyboard location Is there any way on Windows XP to use Dvorak except when a control key Ctrl Alt and or WinLogo is pressed Preferably without having to install any third party app,qwerty

I am developing a Java EE 6 bottom up JAX WS to expose an EJB3 1 stateless session bean The web service in a WAR is failing to install on deployment because it references an external jar or shared library which one can assume is not loaded yet The common suggestion is to include the jars in the lib folder which does fix the issue however the jars need to remain in this external shared library location and NOT in the ear file because they amount to 30MB What are some techniques to get around this issue in a Websphere WAS v 8 environment or any server environment Some suggestions I have found include 1 define classpath in META INF file 2 define the resources in deployment xml 3 alter class loading order 4 from ibm In the case where the jars are part of a Shared Library configured on WebSphere Application Server then a User Library must be used to configure the project for development before generating the WebService However I have been unsuccessful to find any help online in these areas Is there another technique or does anyone know anything about accomplishing this Thanks in advance EDIT If I specify the libraries in the META INF using class path they are loaded before extensions shared libraries etc but they are still loaded after the WAR which is not good Again this isn t a runtime issue because the web services are created at deployment on the fly,classloader

I am trying to update an xml file and save elements inside of an already saved root element I have only found examples where the xml files are just opened and not saved Can someone help me to find the best way to save the results My project right now looks like this I am loading an xml file via URLLoader URLRequest and display the contents in several text fields New text from an input field is saved appended via FileStream directly to the xml file in the applicationStorageDirectory that will be on iPhone The new input should then be added to an on screen list created with a for loop and displayed however it can t get it that far After reading the newly saved input from the xml file I naturally get error 1088 because the xml file is not well formed anymore This is because the input is appended after the root element and the result looks like this lt root gt lt message gt lt message gt lt date gt lt date gt lt root gt lt message gt new input lt message gt lt date gt lt date gt When of course what I want is this lt root gt lt message gt lt message gt lt date gt lt date gt lt message gt new input lt message gt lt date gt lt date gt lt root gt But I have no idea how i can achieve that I made several attempts to avoid having to append like loading the xml content changing it and then writing everything again But since I am still new to as3 I couldn t get it to work It would be great if someone could tell me what the best way to go would be and maybe how to solve it,actionscript

The curl operator vec nabla times mathbb 1 can be written as a skew symmetric 3x3 matrix mathrm curl begin pmatrix 0 amp partial_z amp partial_y partial_z amp 0 amp partial_x partial_y amp partial_x amp 0 end pmatrix in Cartesian coordinates Since mathrm curl mathrm grad 0 and mathrm div mathrm curl 0 the Eigenvector to the Eigenvalue 0 is vec nabla 1 And by calculating det mathrm curl lambda stackrel 0 lambda lambda 2 Delta one obtains that the other two Eigenvalues with opposite signs both satisfy lambda_ pm 2 Delta i e they are the two roots of the negative Laplacian Since mathrm curl 2 mathrm grad mathrm div Delta the Eigenvectors vec f_ pm satisfying mathrm curl 2 vec f_ pm Delta vec f_ pm they have a constant divergence More precisely since they must be orthogonal to vec nabla due to the different Eigenvalues they can be written as vec f_ pm vec g_ pm times vec nabla Since the vec f_ pm are also orthogonal to each other one can obtain vec f_ pm pm lambda_ pm 1 vec f_ mp times vec nabla where the factor pm lambda_ pm 1 was chosen for symmetry and consistency But what is an analytical non recursive expression for them You may already have noticed that the lambda_ pm are Dirac operators so I wouldn t be too surprised if an answer included spinors and partial even though that is in 4D In fact it is most likely that this is the case since apart from vec nabla the vector of gamma or Pauli matrices would not set any preferred direction 1 In the sense that for any scalar function s vec x vec nabla s is an Eigenvector of mathrm curl with Eigenvalue 0 i e forall s mathrm curl vec nabla s 0 cdot vec nabla s It s just like stating x_i partial_j delta_ ij while this only makes sense when acting on something,theory

I have a C networking application that accepts TCP connections from clients and then waits on the socket until the client decides to send data sometimes they won t send anything for a long time and thats OK It mostly detects error conditions when clients crash or machines are turned off but it takes many minutes to notice when the network cable to the client has been unplugged and I would prefer it to notice this condition as soon as possible I don t have control over the clients and I can t make them send something like a ping My server does send out a ping packet to the to the clients but they won t send a response but even when the cable is unplugged write returns the correct number of bytes I see the TCP stack sending retry packets in Wireshark What is the best way to notice the loss of connection It would be most convenient if I could detect it on the write call I need this to work on Windows and on Linux,programming

Recently I manually shut down the computer while running SimCity 4 Deluxe Upon booting the computer froze up at toshiba_acpi Toshiba Extras I then added acpi off into grub cfg to allow me to boot into Linux Mint Battery information like power and temperature were not shown on the battery meter As the only option I could think of I blacklisted the line toshiba_acpi After that I noticed that whatever I inserted into the usb ports could not be detected in Mint or Bios I completely dismantled the computer to replug the USB connection to the motherboard but that didn t help I now think that the manual shutdown resulted in a power surge causing the usb ports to fail which made booting freeze up at toshiba_acpi How can I fix it I ve tried everything If you need more information just ask I spent 7 hours working on this I have a Toshiba Satellite L500D running Linux Mint 13 Motherboard and all other hardware are FINE I completely disassembled the computer to replug the connections update When I connect an optical mouse the red laser appears I m skeptical it was a power surge All help is appreciated PLMA,mint

I m working on a Rails 2 3 app that uses the rails_authorization_plugin to give user account control to various features of the site In addition the app allows different clients to set up their own access controls for their users The problem is if a user is signed up for one client and joins another client his permissions are global across clients and this is not desirable Currently the app does store in the RolesUser table a value for the client id Unfortunately this value is never used when verifying a user s roles My first instinct was to filter it in the model for Authorized Users instead of def acts_as_authorized_user roles_relationship_opts has_many roles_users roles_relationship_opts merge dependent gt delete_all has_many roles through gt roles_usersendI would put def acts_as_authorized_user roles_relationship_opts client_id has_many roles_users roles_relationship_opts merge dependent gt delete_all has_many roles through gt roles_users conditions gt roles_users client_id client_id endI realized this is probably poor practice or not even possible Now the client could be obtained from the subdomain of the request but again poor practice The model should not be concerned with acquiring the client id Next I figured I d pass it in every time I check the user s roles In my User model I have def in_roles roles okay false roles flatten each do role_name if self has_role role_name to_s okay true break end end okayendIf I pass the client id to the plugin I get to the function self roles find_by_name role_name and I don t understand how to filter this by client id Is there a way to use the has_many relationship between roles and roles_users to filter by client_id in the roles_users table I think the through directive with the addition of the acts_as_authorized_user method is causing my confusion,authorization

Suppose you are invoking methods asynchronously onto the UI thread WithUIDispatcher BeginInvoke new Action _insert DispatcherPriority Normal new object you are doing the invocation From now the runtime environment decides when to execute the method whereas the program continues its normal path of execution I am now wondering whether there are any mechanisms to synchronize these asynchronously executed methods when they are returning It seems that there are pretty much the same issues as when using multiple threads But is a returning method that has been invoked asynchronously before considered to be a thread It don t seem so because usual synchronizing efforts likelock someObject or using dedicated locks seem not to work Appendix My actual situation where this issue appears is as follows The asynchronously invoked method calls as its last statement a returnmethod of a static class Inside this return method a commonly used resource a List has to be synchronized Consider the following overview like code snipped to exemplify A simple method that gets invoked asynchronouslypublic void _insert do some code StaticClass Returned public static StaticClass public static void Returned use a shared resource,invocation

I have a software that uses multiple languages which are all available as eclipse plugins java c python The exes call each other I was wondering if there is a way I could debug all these languages using eclipse I have the sources for all of them and all of them are projects in eclipse but so far they work independently and I was wondering whether for example if I added a break point in a C code and called a java program that calls the C code the execution would pause when it reaches the C breakpoint I think this is somehow similar to attaching to a process in Visual Studio though I m not sure whether Visual Studio provides this feature either Is it possible with eclipse or Visual Studio,visual

I have an enterprise application that logs exception information whenever one happens to occur The application is a combination of C and C net I want to get as much information as I can at the time of the exception As of right now we only print out the Message and the stack trace which gives line numbers in debug builds but not release The goal of any error log is to point out the error to the best of its ability as close as it can get I m curious how I can take this farther I want more info As a for instance I know NullReferenceExceptions and InvalidArguementExceptions contain different amounts of information but I m not harnessing anything besides the Message Field Is my best bet to use reflection and capture all the public members and print them out Or perhaps chain TONS of type checks and casts to print them out cleanly As a constraint my logging function needs to just take in an argument of type Exception,reflection

Currently I m following a course on embedded software development The lecturer has chosen J as an architecture language for model driven software development J itself is a very terse programming language and one of his main arguments for this language is its terseness For instance this is a Quicksoft implementation in J quicksort lt gt 1 lt Another argument is that through such a language and the reduced number of characters you introduce less bugs and the time to fix bugs is reduced Since I have a strong software engineering background and through various books like Clean Code Pragmatic Programmer and others I feel that these arguments aren t valid I find that there is a strong movement towards descriptive names and code that reads like natural language alright this might only be related to applications with lots of business logic and less math The question therefore is can you really argue that usage of a terse programming language will result in less errors and that time to fix a bug is reduced Also since the language is terse the number of lines of code is reduced and you would get a better COCOMO rating But can this be applied in the first place or does the COCOMO model use the number of lines of code as a way to estimate a project s overall size project size should be the same whether you implement it in a terse language or in an imperative one but again maybe I didn t understand the COCOMO model correctly UpdateThank you all for your answers Admittedly I should have stated more clearly that my intention was to get more information on the COCOMO model again sorry S Lott As such I feel that Thomas Owens s extensive answer and comments are the best fit for this question Thanks again,code

What I m trying to achieve At the moment I have a UIImagePickerController set up to take a picture and return it as a small sized photo about 300 x 500ish pixels By default the image obtained from the image picker is full resolution i e quite large So before doing anything with this image I resize it UIGraphicsBeginImageContext targetSize CGRect thumbnailRect CGRectZero thumbnailRect origin thumbnailPoint thumbnailRect size width scaledWidth thumbnailRect size height scaledHeight sourceImage drawInRect thumbnailRect newImage UIGraphicsGetImageFromCurrentImageContext UIGraphicsEndImageContext What doesn t work so well This step is quite resource intensive in fact it freezes the app for several seconds during the operation I haven t tried it on an iPhone 4 but I can imagine it will only be worse with HD images Aside from being resource intensive getting this photo also seems to use up a very large amount of memory for a small period of time often resulting in the app crashing I am assuming that this memory is from the large sized images that are being captured at first So What it the best standard method of getting small images from UIImagePicker I don t want my app to freeze or crash due to high CPU or RAM usage Surely there must be a better more stable and efficient way Any help is much appreciated,uiimagepickercontroller

I have a Perl program that someone else created and I am calling on with CruiseControl The program calls on Unix Commands using Cygwin However everytime that the Perl program calls on a Unix like command with a DOS like address I get the well known error cygwin warning MS DOS style path detected E regression Preferred POSIX equivalent is cygdrive e regression CYGWIN environment variable option nodosfilewarning turns off this warning Consult the user s guide for more details about POSIX paths http cygwin com cygwin ug net using html using pathnamesI have set both the User Variable AND System Variable CYGWIN to nodosfilewarning This removes the error when I run the program from the command line but the error still occurs in CruiseControl when called as an automated process from a batch file I have called on both the batch file from the Desktop AND Command Line and ran as an administrator Nothing changes Other NotesFor purposes of this problem I don t have access to the Perl ProgramI am trying to go back to Cygwin 1 5 but since I am using Server 2008 I am encountering compatibility issuesThis is occurring on one of the distributed servers not the main server running the Webdashboard I have read somewhere that this issue may stem from a different user calling on CruiseControl but the issue should have been solved by setting this as an ENV System variable Is it possible to modify the registery to set the ENV variables Thank you in advance,cruisecontrol

We are going to change our server with a new one with 2 scsi hard disk My colleague proposed to install the OS windows 2003 on one disk and put the Databases with sql server 2008 3 of 100 MB and 1 of 2 GB on the other one I was thinking that it would be much more performant to use Raid 0 but i don t have enough knowledge to confirm that and how much would it be more performant Could you please tell me what would be the advantages and inconvenients of both of the methods and which one would be more performant Thank you for your helpVivien,2003
In a post Making Long Scrolls on the iPhone Not Suck Aza Raskin describes an alternative scrollbar control that s better at getting around on very long pages It s not important that the scrollbar remains for some amount of time to activate it I m fine with simply swiping along the right edge of the iPhone s screen to grab hold of the scrollbar handle The idea is that if I drag the handle 3 4 of the way down on the physical screen I d be 3 4 of the way down on the page Tthe Dropbox iPhone app it s great btw has exactly this kind of scrollbar for long PDF documents Regular scrolling is done by dragging anywhere but on the handle dragging the handle moves the view to that location This seems to have been implemented from scratch as I don t think the SDK is flexible enough to customize the behavior of the existing scrollbar However Dropbox uses the native document viewers to show documents on the iPhone so somehow they add the scrollbar functionality to it See the scrollbar handle You can drag that to quickly get somewhere else in the document This concept is very similar to how index bars work in UITableView ie Contacts app the index appears as a bar on the right hand side of the table for example a through z and you can touch a particular label to jump to the target section In this case however a very long page doesn t have sections and it should work for general purpose scrolling not jumping to sections So how can I go about implementing this method of scrolling I m looking for general ideas and specific implementation details I m also interested if an open source implementation exists this seems like a general purpose problem solution,uiscrollview

This might be a bit general question but I have to be sure of building a secure web site and I have doubts about Wamp as i have never used it before I am having troubles to work with IIS6 and CakePHP framework over multiple sites so I am starting to think about changing to Wampserver instead Which would make things easier to make it work over Apache I am wondering now in terms of security do you believe Wampserver can be configured to be as secure as IIS6 Which as the advantages or disadvantages of using Wampserver instead of IIS6 in a Windows 2003 Server machine Thanks,wampserver
I m on Windows and I have SASS running successfully in my project Now I want to include compass so I can take advantage of the pre written mixins etc First I simply tried this statement from within my working sass file import compass css3 transform Naturally this didn t work since I didn t have compass installed so I navigated to my Ruby directory and successfully installed the compass gem within c ruby193 bin I can now successfully create compass projects within c ruby193 bin but that doesn t do me much good I need run compass commands within my site which lives here c inetpub mysite When I try to do so however I get compass is not recognized as internal or external commandHow can I get compass to work where I want it EDIT a large part of my problem was that Ruby was installed without adding itself to the Windows Path environment variables so I could only run SASS and Compass commands from within the C Ruby193 bin directory This caused problems for me since as a result I thought that was where I needed to install compass Anyhow after figuring that out I still haven t been able to get compass to work but am planning on uninstaling SASS Compass and Ruby and giving this thing another try from scratch I marked Stooboo s answer as correct since it was the best and most accurate especially given the information he had to work with Thanks,css

I m searching for an algorithm for recalculation position of vectors which defines polygon which represents one tile I have pattern of tile â a polygon defined by 16 vertices which are in field of vertices For example I have a square or rhombus or any other polynom which can fit together with the same polygon x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x xThis pattern represents one tile If I move with one vertex change its position I have to recalculate position of other vertex in order to have tile which fit together with other tiles 1 Does any algorithm exist which already solves that 2 What is a good basic pattern Square is too simple I heard that is good to have symmetric shapes for patterns cause it s easier to recalculate it Edit Motivation is to draw tiles on some bitmap It s like tiles in your bathroom they must also fit together,2d
We have two databases on different database servers MS SQL Server 2008 We need to insert data in two tables one on each of the two database servers and it all needs to be within a transaction so we need a distributed transaction We are inserting the data from a NET program and I think we have got two options here In NET using the TransactionScope class to initiate a distributed transaction This worked on my dev machine in a test environment but only AFTER I set up the DTC to allow communication with the network However the NET app will run eventually on client machines and they might not have set up the DTC on their operating system accordingly And they are normal users no admins on their machines So my first question is Can I use the TransactionScope class in NET on computers even if the DTC isn t set up is their a way around this programmatically via my NET program If the NET way is not an option would it be a good idea to use a stored procedure that builds up a distributed transaction via a linked server Thanks all for your replies,linked

This may be trivial but I would appreciate if someone could point me in the right direction here I am trying to express the number of instances in a loop nest in a general form As a mathematical expression I would think this would be a multiple summation Example loop nest for k in f_1 N for j in f_2 k for i in f_3 k j do somethingWhere f_n x is a function that generates a set of indices for loop n given input x I would say that each loop nest function can take as input any of the outer indices or not it could be completely static independent not quite sure if I ve expressed that right From that I have sum_ k f_ 1 N sum_ j f_ 2 k f_ 3 k j Assuming this is correct which it may not be how would one make this more generic to handle any number of loops say in the form with loop l 1 N,notation
I m having trouble building a specific query to select records Here is a dumbed down example of what I m trying to achieve Let s say I have a table called Criteria that looks something like this ID Unit Product Part 1 sports bike handle 2 sports 3 furn couch etc And I have a table called Entries that looks something like this ID Tuple 1 sports bike seat 2 sports racket frame 3 furn desk leg 4 furn lamp shade etc Record 1 in Criteria suggests that any tuple that is sports bike handle qualifies Record 2 in Criteria where the Product and Part contain spaces suggests that any tuple beginning with sports qualifies sports Record 3 suggests that any tuple beginning with furn and couch qualifies furn couch I want to select all the records that don t qualify for any of the criteria In this case records 3 and 4 from Entries should be returned because they don t match any of the given criteria I m new to SQL so I m having trouble coming up with a suitable query My thought process is along these lines For each record of Criteria build a string comparison string based on the Unit Product and Part For record 1 for example the string would be sports bike handle For record 2 the string would be sports and for record 3 furn couch Now select all records where Tuple does not equal any of those strings I m having trouble translating this into SQL terms and that is where I need your help,2008

So I have a pretty good understanding of java EE in general including EJB and their scopes but am having a bit of a hard time coming to conclusive results on this issue First of all I have found alot of posts that specifically state you should not inject Stateful beans into Stateless beans servlets or jsf ManagedBeans And while this does make sense in one way one Stateless bean could be passed to a different session client on its 5th or Xth method invocation it also doesn t add up in a couple of other ways to me Also I know how Stateless sessionbeans should basically have the same state in all its instances hence allowing one bean to be replaced by another for any given method invocation on the bean regardless of the client session caller This again ties back to the paragraph above But lets move on the the problem part or rather the lack of it 1 I have a perfectly functional web application where all the EJB service beans were previously annotated with Stateful I started thinking about this today though and none of those service beans are dependant on the conversational state with the client they just perform services So I went ahead and refactored them to Stateless And I might add that these beans did indeed use Inject to get access to a Stateful sessionbean for which in turn it does make sense to be Stateful as it holds some information about the user currently logged in While I haven t done extensive testing of it I did run through a few scenarios and it certainly seems to work well 2 It seems reasonable to me that if a Stateless sessionbean has an Inject ed Stateful bean this injection would be handled appropriately by CDI injecting the Stateful bean that is indeed associated with the session from which the Stateless bean was called Again the tests seem to indicate this which is the reason why I m a bit puzzled 3 If indeed we should never Inject Stateful beans into Stateless ones nor into JSF ManagedBeans nor into servlets then how on earth should we call their service methods in a web application It seems to me for this theory to hold we would have to only call those Stateful beans from jsf ManagedBean with SessionScope or directly from a xhtml page having first marked the Stateful with Named Does this really make sense I might also add that this scope SessionScoped on ManagedBeans feels extremely redundant to me we haven t used it once in the project for said web application but rely solely on ManagedBean with RequestScoped OR ViewScoped annotations I guess what I am really asking here is does it really hold true that we should never inject Stateful beans into Stateless ones And What are your thoughts on my points above Cheers Andreas,session

I write a lot of code most of it I throw away eventually when I am done with it recently I was thinking that if I just kept every small piece of utility script I wrote named it tagged it and filed it in a dev shell I will never loose the code and on top of that I won t need to redo something I have done already which is the main motivation as I keep finding myself writing something I ve done earlier Is there a ASP NET shell style environment anywhere If not what would be the best way to go about this I am looking to be able to do the following 1 Write big or small bits of code 2 Derive from or chain together alread written code libraries services 3 Ability to have everything on my desktop would that mean IIS on the desktop or is there an lighter weight mechanism sync ed with the server at home so if I am on the move I can still access this and make this part of my day to day workflow I hope that is not asking too much,portability

IE yet again is proving to be the bane of my existence The top of a site I m working on has a horizontal menu an item of which triggers a pure CSS menu that is positioned absolute within the parent menu DIV positioned relative This places the menu perfectly in both IE and the W3C compliant browsers The problem arises when I have more positioned elements further down on the page These are also positioned relative because there is data inside them that needs to be positioned absolute again this displays properly in all browsers I ve tested it on The problem is that then the top menu is opened part is obscured by the positioned elements further down the page in effect it s positioned BELOW these elements even though there are z index properties defined on all in both the CSS file and inline The only way to get IE to display this properly is to place the actual HTML for the menu at the bottom of the page below in DOM terms the positioned elements elsewhere on the page I would only do this as an absolute last resort All Elements are the same type div Here is the relevant HTML lt div id menu gt lt div id cat_menu style display none z index 10000 gt lt table cellspacing 0 cellpadding 0 class brmenu width 100 gt data lt table gt lt div gt lt div class product_new style z index 20 gt data lt div gt lt div class product_listing style background color FFFFFF gt data lt div gt And the relevant CSS div menu height 26px padding 0 position relative div cat_menu position absolute top 25px left 115px width 300px z index 1000 div product_new background image url images sp_images png background position 0 108px background repeat no repeat padding 0px height 40px font size 9pt margin top 5px position relative z index 20,index

I have a custom patch for Quartz Composer that is a multicast receiver It fires up a NSThread for the daemon and then restarts it when the user changes the multicast address or port number When the patch starts I do the following to launch a new thread daemonThread NSThread alloc Then every time I start or restart the thread I reinitialize it like daemonThread initWithTarget multicastDaemon selector selector doWorkWithDelegate object self daemonThread start Of course I terminate the thread each time before I restart it I m not using garbage collection and I do release the daemonThread when the patch exits My concern is that I m not sure what happens when I re initialize this thread over and over like that I ve noticed that Instruments tells me I m leaking an NSThread and a autoreleasepool which I suspect may be my pool from the daemon thread I can see that these numbers increment each time I restart the process but I m not familiar enough with Instruments to know what it s telling me Should I be worried,nsautoreleasepool

Now that RC1 is out I need to decide once and for all whether to use MS Ajax libraries or just jQuery for AJAX requests The application is a new application Essentially the way I ll decide is whether or not i get any significant benefit from the Microsoft libraries that I wouldn t get from jQuery I already HAVE jQuery loading and I am concerned about the extra overhead of file size more than anything As far as I m aware the only benefit really is that there are helpers like Ajax BeginForm but perhaps these will work with jQuery at some point anyway I was also told today by a government employee friend of mine that MS Ajax library has a LOT of bugs in it which concerns me With Microsoft now having officially befriended jQuery I wouldn t be too worried about them doing anything in future to leave jQuery in the dust by enhancing their own libraries I really don t know a whole lot about exactly what MS Ajax actually does for me Are there certain pros and cons Or is it just 90 bloat to support update panel I also find it very interesting that the ASP NET MVC in Action book just skips over the MS Ajax libraries and jumps straight into jQuery In this chapter the reader will examine how the ajax technique is applied to ASP NET MVC in a more seamless way than with Web Forms The reader will see how to leverage an increasingly popular lightweight javascript library called jQuery from free sample chapter on AJAX Would very much appreciate hearing from anyone about their experiences workin with both expecially on the following additional questions is it easy to convert code between the two libraries assuming relatively simple ajax requirements is debugging notably better or faster in either libraryanybody know how ASP NET 4 0 is progressing and any announced plans for the AJAX library that might be beneficial to MVC what in a nutshell could MS AJAX do for an MVC app beyond sending requests and sticking the response in a DIV how do i do the equivalent of Ajax BeginForm and use jQuery what was your deal killer one way or the other what are most people out there using,asp

Suppose you want to compute the sum of the square of the differences of items sum_ i 1 N 1 x_i x_ i 1 2 the simplest code the input is std vector lt double gt xs the ouput sum2 is double sum2 0 double prev xs 0 for vector const_iterator i xs begin 1 i xs end i sum2 prev i prev i only 1 with compiler optimizationprev i I hope that the compiler do the optimization in the comment above If N is the length of xs you have N 1 multiplications and 2N 3 sums sums means or Now suppose you know this variable x_1 2 x_N 2 2 sum_ i 2 N 1 x_i 2 and call it sum Expanding the binomial square sum_i N 1 x_i x_ i 1 2 sum 2 sum_ i 1 N 1 x_i x_ i 1 so the code becomes double sum2 0 double prev xs 0 for vector const_iterator i xs begin 1 i xs end i sum2 i prev prev i sum2 sum2 2 sum Here I have N multiplications and N 1 additions In my case N is about 100 Well compiling with g O2 I got no speed up I try calling the inlined function 2M times why,point

I m trying to replace an existing serializer with protobuf for C by Marc Gravell My code is extensive and my goal is to be able to do the switch with minimal changes I came across an issue which I believe I understand why it happens but require help with overcoming particularly a solution that would require the least changes in my already existing code and classes My code is complex so I created the following short sample to demonstrate the issue using System using System Collections Generic using System IO using ProtoBuf namespace ConsoleApplication1 class program_issue ProtoContract public class Father public Father sonny new Son ProtoMember 101 public string Name ProtoMember 102 public Son sonny ProtoContract public class Son public Son Dict Add 10 ten ProtoMember 103 public Dictionary lt int string gt Dict new Dictionary lt int string gt static void Main string args Father f1 new Father f1 Name Hello byte bts PBSerializer Serialize typeof Father f1 Father f2 PBSerializer Deserialize bts out f2 public static class PBSerializer public static byte Serialize Type objType object obj MemoryStream stream new MemoryStream ProtoBuf Serializer Serialize stream obj string s Convert ToBase64String stream ToArray byte bytes stream ToArray return bytes public static void Deserialize byte data out Father obj using MemoryStream stream new MemoryStream data obj ProtoBuf Serializer Deserialize lt Father gt stream In short when the parent object is created it creates a son object which inits a dictionary with some values I assume that when protobuf tries to rebuild the object when deserializing it uses the same constructor thus also initiating the dictionary with values and then tries to push the same values again as part of the deserializing error How can I overcome it with minimal changes to my code Kind regards Yossi,protobuf

I know that Scala has var for mutable state but pure functional programming discourages use of any mutable state and rather focuses on using val for everything Coming from an imperative world it s hard to let go of mutable state My question is when is it okay to use var in your Scala code Can all code really be done using just val If yes then why does Scala have vars,mutable
I am using various styles in my maps implementation through the maps api They all work very well I m using a function to parse the above style and generate the URL to be used with the static maps api The function works great but it seems both apis respond differently to the stylers As a note all my styles definitions in JS start with setting all layers visibility to off I then add only the layers I want to display I ve found this much more convenient in creating styles For example specifying a common style rule for all landscape objects in the JS api featureType landscape elementType geometry stylers visibility on color F5F5F5 This would amount to the below for the static map api amp style feature landscape 7Celement geometry 7Cvisibility on 7Chue 0xF5F5F5 7Csaturation 0 7Clightness 96 Still the static map will return an image where both landscape and manmade layers are differentiated in colors Has this happened to anyone before Any idea on how to address it I ve tried specifying both landscape manmade and landscape natural with the same exact values but it didnt work I also tried turning visibility off on landscape man_made but it failed too Thanks in advance for your help,maps

What is the best way of supporting optional data passed to a C function I have web service function in Net which defines 5 arguments WebMethod public string UploadFile string wsURL byte incomingArray string FileName string RecordTypeName MetaData metaDataArray The code of this function is not too long but not trivial either and there is only one place in the the function where I perform this test if there is any MetaData to be processed if metaDataArray Length gt 0 Update update BuildMetaData metaDataArray treq2 Items new Operation sru cin update fetch else treq2 Items new Operation sru cin fetch I needed a quick and dirty version of the above which only takes 4 arguments i e no Metadata array as a final argument so I cloned the whole function and removed the IF ELSE block refering to metadata Ugly I know WebMethod public string UploadFileBasic string wsURL byte incomingArray string FileName string RecordTypeName Now I want to do things better and I am looking for advice on the best way to support this I do not want to burden the client program with creating an empty array as a 5th parameter I want to have my web service functions to be smart enough to handle this optional data Thanks,arguments

I m sure this has been asked and answered before but I wasn t able to find it so hopefully this will at least link someone to the right place I want to find out my local interface and ip address used to reach a certain host For instance if I had 3 adapters connected to my box and they all three went to different networks I d like to know which of the three specifically its ip address is used to reach my local intranet in this case it would be a vpn tunnel interface I suspect this is a job for ifconfig or traceroute but I haven t been able to find the correct switches I m running OSX 10 7 Darwin EDIT For easy access This is what I ended up writing to get the trick done ifconfig route get lt host gt grep interface sed s 1 grep inet sed s inet 0 9 1 Any improvements optimizations are welcome,lion
What would be a reasonable and logical directory into which to deploy my production Rails apps on a Linux system Some candidates var rails lt There s a var www so this would be consistent with that pattern But I T guys have complained about stuff in var before home my_home_dir rails lt OK not var but I m not the only developer Seems like it really ought to be a systemwide location home rails lt I don t know That just seems weird rails lt Seems even weirder What is the least astonishing most normal thing to do here Background info a Rails app is a bunch of server side code written in Ruby along with a public dir containing JavaScript CSS and maybe a little HTML The public dir is mapped to an Apache vhost Apache handles the Ruby code through a module called Passenger or mod_rails Thanks for the help all I think I m going to go with opt deployed_rails_apps I like long expository directory names and tab completion var is also a good place but I ve gotten stern grumbling from I T when I tried to deploy stuff there If it were my own machine I might go with var or srv,on

I have been reading a lot of articles explaining how to set up Entity Framework s DbContext so that only one is created and used per HTTP web request using various DI frameworks My question is why is this a good idea in the first place What advantages do you gain by using this approach Are there certain situations where this would be a good idea Are there things that you can do using this technique that you can t do when instantiating DbContexts per repository method call Please forgive my ignorance but I m really trying to understand why,dependency

I m building a program that uses plugins Unfortunately the plugin framework s dynamic linking forces the RTL and VCL out of my project EXE and into the BPL versions and they don t have debug info enabled So I built a testing framework that links to my plugins statically so I can actually see what I m doing while tracing through the code But now every time I try to recompile I get an error unit turbu_skills was compiled with a different version of turbu_database GDatabase I ve seen this error before but only when I ve been changing things I probably shouldn t have been like the RTL or VCL libraries I don t understand why it s doing that with my own code The turbu_skills and turbu_database units are both units I wrote myself GDatabase is a global singleton variable whose class definition I haven t changed in weeks Any change that triggers a recompile causes this error even if I haven t touched anything in either of the units Doing a full build SHIFT F9 causes it to compile correctly But if I then press SPACE in a unit any unit and hit F9 I get the error again What s going on and how do I stop it This doesn t happen in the main app only the testing framework EDIT I have the source to all of my units Deleting DCUs and similar files doesn t help Copying the entire project to a different computer deleting all DCUs and building there doesn t help There s an objective reproducible conflict between the layout of my program and the compiler and I want to be rid of it The source can be found at http www turbu rpg com downloads Turbu_source_setup exe if anyone wants to test it It requires Delphi 2009 with the JVCL already installed the installer package will take care of the rest Maybe having the source code available will help someone track this down I certainly hope so because wherever the issue is it s beyond me The problem can be found in testing exe and also in turbu exe in turbu groupproj EDIT 2 Turns out this was another cross unit generics issue Grr I managed to code a workaround I just hope they get the generics problems fixed soon,delphi

I am looking at a specific problem where I need to build a recommender The generalized problem is as follows Each user has registered for say x courses c1 c2 c3 cx Depending on each course I need to provide say top 5 tips recommendations to the user e g study materials that could be useful etc I need collaborative elements to be applied to learn what recommendations are proving helpful to users I looked at the recommendation engines like Apache Mahout Taste but I am unable to model my problem in a way that it looks like the examples shown The extra filtering criteria where a user is associated with one or more courses and each recommendation tip could be associated with one or more courses is throwing me off Please let me know if there is any good way of modeling such a problem Any pointers to documentation examples would be very appreciated I am just starting my research in this area so please bear with me if I have misunderstood any concepts Thanks Vivek,engine

I ve a Core Data model class with a customer ID attribute It s bound to a form cell When the user finishes editing the text I want a chance to convert their entry to upper case using logic which depends on the old and new values Ideally I want to keep the behavior close to the view where it belongs using an object I can instantiate in the nib and hook up to the text cells But I d settle for an object I had to hook up to the model I ve implemented this three different ways Custom setter method in the model classText editing delegate implementing NSControlTextEditingDelegateHelper class which uses KVO to notice the change and initiate a subsequent changeAll three implementations have problems The issues respectively This behavior doesn t belong in the model I should be able to set the attribute in code for example without triggering it I can t get the before value because the form cell doesn t provide controlTextDidBeginEditing calls and the old value is gone by the time controlTextDidEndEditing is called Furthermore tabbing in and out of the field without typing anything triggers a call to controlTextDidEndEditing When the observation fires for the user s change and I initiate a subsequent change to that property the view ignores the change notification and doesn t redraw I presume the binder does this for efficiency Normally when updating the model it can ignore the KVO observations from the field being updated How would you solve this problem,value

I have a Dell Optiplex 960 desktop running Windows 7 64 bit at work I typically leave it locked rather than logged off when I go home so that I m able to remote in from home and continue working if I wish This is where the problem comes in If I don t remote in there is no problem and I can simply unlock the next morning It s when I do remote in that I have a problem Remote sessions work as expected but when I get to work the next morning the machine appears to have gone into a sleep or hibernate state from which no amount of mouse moving or keyboard pounding will wake it The machine is not hanging as remote sessions to it are still possible it seems that physical access from it s own mouse and keyboard are lost The only way to gain access is to press and hold the power switch for several seconds until the machine shuts down Of course this means Windows does not gracefully shut down and after powering up it takes several minutes for the machine to boot and reach the login prompt presumably while it checks the disk Has anyone else seen something like this,freeze

The following declaration at the window level var event for IE var event anything for Chromewill destroy the event object as used here lt div onMouseOver alert event type gt Mouseover Div lt div gt Firefox does not seem phased by either declaration I realize that declaring a variable with the name event is bad code but I am curious about the technical difference here e g that the use of var in IE reinitializes the variable to null whereas Chrome will not overwrite with a var declaration unless a value is explicitly assigned and maybe FF holds the event object outside of the window s var declaration scope altogether This is more of a curiosity I ran into a bug in IE on a site outside of my control that was caused by this and the more I looked into the more I saw subtle differences between browsers Just wondering if anyone had any insights here,events

I ve come across a rather interesting occurrence in a WinForms app I m developing It seems that when I add a DropDownItem to a ToolStripMenuItem the shortcut key on the parent menu item disappears And it s not just that the shortcut key isn t shown it no longer registers the keypress at all If I remove the submenu items the shortcut key comes back Surprisingly everything looks just fine in the designer this doesn t appear to happen until runtime Menu In The Designer Same menu at runtime Does anyone know why this is happening and how I can prevent it And to clarify clicking on the parent menu carries out different functionality than clicking on the submenu so moving the shortcut is not sufficient If I click on the menus manually all functionality is carried out as expected It is only the shortcut key that no longer works,shortcuts

I am developing a REST api which has a thin web client and a mobile app The application authorizes using facebook oauth My question is how should I implement authentication for my application What is the best way I can allow the users to use the same account to login to the API I know the ideal way is to go by OAuth with a REST api I need some example code for setting up ouath server as well as client in nodejs I have had a look at some oauth modules in node js they din t work properly may be because they are not maintained regularly OR I could use the same accessToken sent by facebook in the header everytime I make a request to the server and hence authenticating the user I found a very similar question here but there was no answer What are your suggestions and how should I go about this The API is in nodejs using express and the web client is in backbonejs,oauth
How with minimum code uglification can I write a debugging hook in a Swing program that would tell me which component in the hierarchy is actually handling each KeyStroke or mouse click and performing the action mapped to it in the component s action map We are writing a complicated GUI and it would be very useful to know this information,framewo
When I try to download a file via HTTP the downloads sometimes stop after around 30 MB The download rates goes down to 0 B s and no data keeps coming When I stop the download and resume again the download still hangs But when I redownload it from byte 0 again everything works fine up to 30 MB when it stops again Sometimes after some hours it just works again without problems The position in the file when the download stops is variable but most of the time it is around 30â 35 MB As a download manager I use wget The same behaviour happens though using curl and other download managers The error occurs independently of the server I download from I have also observed this error on other Linux computers in my network All computers on my network run Gentoo Linux on x86 All internet connections on my network go through a server on my network which runs a transparent Squid proxy on port 80 That server is connected to a router which is a Speedport W 700V by Deutsche Telekom AG That router is connected to the internet using ADSL with 448 kbit s down speed and 96 kbit s up speed I am almost sure that my transparent proxy is not the problem I turned that off without resolving the issue I also connected to the router directly via WLAN without resolving the issue I also tried to download over another port via HTTP Furthermore I tried to download the file using IPv6 with a gateway6 tunnel from my computer which resulted in exactly the same problem Now the strange thing is that everything works fine using FTP and HTTPS also with wget on the same computer Even more strange when I resume the download that hanged over HTTP using FTP or HTTPS download a few bytes that way stop wget and then resume again using HTTP it loads data again But after a few MB it may stop again Unfortunately files downloaded that way are always broken the MD5 sum is not correct so at some point there must have been bogus data I tried searching for HTML error messages in the downloaded file but grep i html does not find anything I cannot think of a way to search for GZIP compressed HTML error messages in the file so I did not try that I tried using strace on wget when it failed to resume a download you can find the entire output on pastebin The important lines are repeated every second clock_gettime CLOCK_MONOTONIC 326102 62176435 0 1write 2 78 19578 110 683 685 K s 195select 4 3 NULL NULL 0 949999 0 Timeout I have absolutely no idea what could be the reason of this problem It seems like whatever causes the issue speaks HTTP It seems to speak HTTP that intelligently that it even regognises it in an IPv6 over IPv4 tunnel But what could that be and why does it only happen sometimes The other possibility would be that there is a problem on my computer that is the same on other Gentoo Linux computers as well Has anyone ever had such a problem What could be the reason and where do I have to continue investigating to find out more about the issue Update I have just run into the problem again and tried to resume the download over the routerâ s WLAN and this time it worked Maybe I did something wrong during my last tests with the WLAN Now maybe my transparent proxy server is in fact the problem It is a very basic Squid proxy server that does not cache anything Maybe the fact is interesting that a second Squid proxy runs on the same computer on another port Update A download hung again and this time I turned off all firewall settings and stopped all proxy servers I failed to resume the download from my network server which is directly connected to the router So my proxy server definitely is not the cause the problem I will try to upgrade the firmware of my router now although I do not have admin access to it I will see what I can do Update Upgrading to the newest firmware of my router didnâ t help I can see no other possibility than this being my ISPâ s fault My â solutionâ is now to tunnel all traffic through an SSH server somewhere else,resume
I want to get the most recent word entered by the user from the UITextView The user can enter a word anywhere in the UITextView in the middle or in the end or in the beginning I would consider it a word when the user finishes typing it and presses a space and does any corrections using the Suggestions from the UIMenuController Example User types in kimd in the UITextView somewhere in the middle of text he gets a popup for autocorrection kind which he does After he does that I want to capture kind and use it in my application I searched a lot on the internet but found solutions that talk about when the user enters text in the end I also tried detecting a space and then doing a backward search until another space after some text is found so that i can qualify it as a word But I think there may be better ways to do this I have read somewhere that iOS caches the recent text that we enter in a text field or text view If I can pop off the top one that s all I want I just need handle to that object I would really appreciate the help Note The user can enter text anywhere in UItextview I need the most recent entered wordThanks,uimenucontroller
Possible Duplicate How do I convert lens mm to optical zoom times How can I obtain the X factor for a lens I thought that to get the X factor I had to divide the largest focal length by the smallest one using this my 18 55mm lens is a 3x one and the 100 300mm would also be a 3x one even if they are obviously very different lenses,camera
I have a user control on a page of a website that generates a text box The textbox has a width specified but the text box is intermitently being shown at a much smaller width than is specified in the code I asked the users to send me copies of the view source output so that I could compare good and bad results By intermittent I mean similar builds different computers Please note that the bad results are ALWAYS displayed on the same bad computers there is more than one user with this problem and conversely the good computers all with the same version of IE7 as the bad computers always display good results When the page is displayed correctly the html that is sent to the browser looks like this lt input name ShortDescription type text maxlength 100 id ShortDescription class content style width 800px gt and when it renders incorrectly it looks like this lt input name ShortDescription type text maxlength 100 id ShortDescription class content gt In both cases the ASP NET code is lt asp textbox id ShortDescription runat server CssClass content Width 800px MaxLength 100 gt lt asp textbox gt I am not sure why the style tag is getting dropped The above pages were both viewed in the same browser IE7 on different computers The computers have a corporate build so they should be configured the same I would appreciate any help,coding
I am working In java on a recursive image processing algorithm that recursively traverses the pixels of the image outward from a center point Unfortunately That causes stack overflows so I have decided to switch to a Queue based algorithm Now this is all fine and dandy But considering the fact that its queue will be analyzing THOUSANDS of pixels in a very short amount of time while constantly popping and pushing WITHOUT maintaining a predictable state It could be anywhere between length 100 and 20000 The queue implementation needs to have significantly fast popping and pushing abilities A linked list seems attractive due to its ability to push elements unto its self without rearranging anything else in the list but in order for it to be fast enough it would need easy access to both its head AND its tail or second to last node if it were not doubly linked Sadly though I cannot find any information related to the underlying implementation of linked lists in Java so it s hard to say if a linked list is really the way to go This brings me to my question What would be the best implementation of the Queue interface in Java for what I intend to do I do not wish to edit or even access anything other than the head and tail of the queue I do not wish to do any sort of rearranging or anything On the flip side I DO intend to do a lot of pushing and popping and the queue will be changing size quite a bit so preallocating would be inefficient,fit

My teacher have given us a acm problem about a math problem I ve tried but get the TLE Here is the problem Euler s Totient function Ï n sometimes called the phi function is used to determine the number of numbers less than n which are relatively prime to n For example as 1 2 4 5 7 and 8 are all less than nine and relatively prime to nine Ï 9 6 HG is the master of X Y One day HG wants to teachers XY something about Euler s Totient function by a mathematic game That is HG gives a positive integer N and XY tells his master the value of 2 lt n lt N for which Ï n is a maximum Soon HG finds that this seems a little easy for XY who is a primer of Lupus because XY gives the right answer very fast by a small program So HG makes some changes For this time XY will tells him the value of 2 lt n lt N for which n Ï n is a maximum This time XY meets some difficult because he has no enough knowledge to solve this problem Now he needs your help InputThere are T test cases 1 lt T lt 50000

Possible Duplicate How do I number equations only if they are referred to in the text While I am writing a document I like to use align rather than align and label them for all equations that I write in case I need to refer to them later in the document I end up not referencing some of the equations I have labeled I was wondering if there is an easy way to strip equation numbers for equations that are not called using eqref anywhere in the document I can imagine this can be a difficult task where LaTeX will have to keep a list of labels and a list of eqrefs and then unless the document is changed between compilations un number the ones in its list of labels that are not found in the list of eqrefs Well worth asking anyway,align

I want to design a protocol between several components I have each can run in separate process on a different host There is always an initiator client and someone who respond server the client might be in several languages java c c cli The server in my case is always in java So I thought about the following properties It should by plain text so it will be easy to debug It should allow upgrade seemplessly of one side it means no class serialization and no strict method signatures If it is a framework the in should be thin WSDL looks too much for my needs I thought using http over tcp I am interested mostly in the syntax and if there are frameworks in java which already provides such capabilities I remember vaguely that there is something like that in Spring EDIT I prefer a thin framework and also I am afraid that changing method signature in RPC will cause competability problems I found this example and it might feet my needs as I am already using jaxb,protocols

i have read articles that say using the prototype will be fastest since functions declared are shared more detail was explained in this article where tapping JS native prototype will increase performance as compared to using improvisions closures should perform worse since each creation of it returns a separate copy of a set of functions and variables objects functions are sort of closures but with this has access control public private they re supposed to be better than closures object literals the one looking like JSON act like objects but have no sense of privacy they are comparable to static methods in JAVA i have no article to refer i just included this for comparison i was testing a simple comparison of the 4 methods using jsperf in building Classes before i proceed with my project and i was looking forward to prototypes winning however closures beat them hands down how come is there some give and take here unseen bias i may not be new to JS but i m totally new to these optimization concepts please bear with me i m still studying about these things,prototype

What is the best way to reset the scroll position to the top of page after the an asynchronous postback The asynchronous postback is initiated from a ASP NET GridView CommandField column and the ASP NET update panel Update method is called in the GridView OnRowCommand My current application is an ASP NET 3 5 web site EDIT I have received excellent feedback from everyone and I ended using the PageRequestManager method in a script tag but my next question is How do I configure it to only execute when the user clicks the ASP NET CommandField in my GridView control I have other buttons on the page that perform an asynchronous postback that I do not want to scroll to the top of the page EDIT 1 I have developed a solution where I do not need to use the PageRequestManager See my follow up answer for solution,asp
I have a lot of session state when programming shell windows ides virtual machines web browsers This is all lost when the session ends i e when logging out or rebooting Is there a way to save the desktop state on MS Windows XP and have it restored later Ideally the solution would allow multiple sessions to be saved and allow any one to be restored I m not asking for the application state to be preserved although that would be nice just the fact the application is running and where its windows are This is trivial in most X Windows system but I can t find a way to do it on MS Windows,environment

I have some code I m porting to a new platform and it started giving me an error about comparing two enumerators from two different enumerator lists I m confused why it s giving me an error about this The enumeration specificers section of the C spec 6 7 2 2 states The identifiers in an enumerator list are declared as constants that have type int and may appear wherever such are permitted 127 An enumerator with defines its enumeration constant as the value of the constant expression If the first enumerator has no the value of its enumeration constant is 0 So I should be able to use enum members the same as int constants In this small sample program enum first a b enum second c d int main enum first myf a enum second mys c if myf mys printf same value n return 0 When compiled with gcc Wall Werror I get the message error comparison between â enum firstâ and â enum secondâ Werror enum compare I know that if I typecast both myf and mys as ints the compiler will be happy just like I could set a couple of ints with the values from myf and mys and do the comparison but why do I have to do either of these to get rid of the warning Why does this warning exist in the first place There must be some danger in doing this that I m not seeing NOTE I have read the gcc documentation on this enum compare flag but it doesn t say much of anything Wenum compare Warn about a comparison between values of different enumerated types In C enumeral mismatches in conditional expressions are also diagnosed and the warning is enabled by default In C this warning is enabled by Wall,integer
Yesterday I installed Delphi XE2 using the download option so I guess the installed files came from Embarcadero up to date as 1st Nov I assume that I therefore acquired Update 1 the one that otherwise needed a complete reinstall To check clicking Check for updates in the program group produces No updates available yet Help About shows only Help Release 1 for Delphi XE2 in Installed Updates I now see a link to Marco Cantu s site at http blog marcocantu com blog delphi_xe2_update2 html which talks about an update 2 but you have to have update 1 already in place Can anyone comment on the installation that I have I dont want to continue installing libraries if I ve got to reinstall it again,xe2

I have an ActiveRecord model Language with columns id and short_code there are other columns but they are not relevant to this question I want to create a method that will be given a list of short codes and return a list of IDs I do not care about associations I just need to end up with an array that looks like 1 2 3 My first thought was to do something likedef get_ids_from_short_codes short_codes Language find_all_by_short_code short_codes flatten select gt id map amp id endbut I m not sure if that s needlessly wasting time memory processing My question is twofold Is there a way to run an ActiveRecord find that will just return an array of a certain table column rather than instantiating objects If so would it actually be worthwhile to collect an array of length n rather than instantiating n ActiveRecord objects Note that for my specific purpose n would be approximately 200,activerecord

The problem is this I have a 320gb HDD splitted in 4 partitions When I first installed Windows XP I formatted the HDD in 3 Windows system partition Media partition and another one I left for Linux However Linux requires another partition for swap Everything was just fine One day Windows stopped working and I tried re installing it After the system was ready to start Windows failed to boot with NTLDR is missing message I tried to recover the Master boot record even replaced NTLDR manually nothing worked I read that in order a HDD to be partitioned in more than 3 parts the so called extended partitions must be created I think this may cause the problem but I don t want to wipe out everything I have more than 100 GB of books most of which are not available anymore in the same locations I have downloaded them,boot
So my current project is mostly in Python but I m looking to rewrite the most computationally expensive portions in C to try and boost performance Much of this I can achieve via simple functions loaded from DLL files but not everything I have a multidimensional array in Python that I want to perform operations on in C particularly A pathfinding but I m not really sure how to translate them and constantly sending data one piece at a time into a loaded function seems really inefficient the array s first two dimensions are in the low hundreds and the functions will need to deal with scores if not hundreds of elements in the array at a time My idea was to have a class in C that creates its own copy of the array at setup where performance isn t as much of an issue and has methods that are performed on the array and return data to the main Python program However I m not sure how to accomplish this and even if this is the proper way to go about such a thing that would seem to imply having C code running parallel to the main Python program and intuition tells me that s a bad idea I don t know much about integrating C and Python beyond how to load simple functions via cTypes in Python so I d really appreciate some pointers here Keep in mind I m relatively new to C at all most of my programming experience is in Python What would be the best way to fit the two together in this situation,array

I m new to the world of UniObjects as I ve been in NET land since it debuted After building a simple app to return the select list of a UniCommand statement I noticed that there are some major differences in how UniData and how UniObjects parses the UniCommand statments From what I ve found it looks like it is differences in the flavors of PICK used What I m asking is for other UniObjects programmers UniVerse or UniData that know of the differences or know of commands that can be executed to list them here I m asking this because the documentation of what can and cannot be a command is very hard to find Here is an example both return the same results from the same source What we would enter into UniData parser error if given in UniCommand SELECT COLORS BLU What should be entered into UniObject s UniCommand SELECT COLORS WITH ID LIKE BLU Notice how UniData s wildcard is square bracket where UniCommand is the elipsis Also notice how UniData accepts the equality operator and how UniCommand uses the LIKE operator and WITH Also if anyone has a link to a document on all the commands available they can post it here as well,uniobjects

I m trying to implement a geometry templating engine One of the parts is taking a prototypical polygonal mesh and aligning an instantiation with some points in the larger object So the problem is this given 3d point positions for some perhaps all of the verts in a polygonal mesh find a scaled rotation that minimizes the difference between the transformed verts and the given point positions I also have a centerpoint that can remain fixed if that helps The correspondence between the verts and the 3d locations is fixed I m thinking this could be done by solving for the coefficients of a transformation matrix but I m a little unsure how to build the system to solve An example of this is a cube The prototype would be the unit cube centered at the origin with vert indices 4 5 6 7 0 1 2 3An example of the vert locations to fit v0 1 243 2 163 3 426 v1 4 190 0 408 0 485 v2 1 974 1 525 3 426 v3 0 974 4 096 0 485 v5 1 974 1 525 3 426 v7 1 243 2 163 3 426So given that prototype and those points how do I find the single scale factor and the rotation about x y and z that will minimize the distance between the verts and those positions It would be best for the method to be generalizable to an arbitrary mesh not just a cube,computational
I have a singleton route that looks like this resource avatar only gt edit update When a user edits the avatar they go to avatar edit to view the form when they save they are sent with a put request to avatar and then redirected back to avatar edit What should happen when we get a GET request to avatar At the moment the route is not recognized and a generic 404 is returned But this happens way more often than it should so I feel we should do something about it I m tempted to add a get avatar gt redirection avatar edit Any reason not to do that any dangers in doing it I m not sure I have all the reasons why this error happen but I know some There s an error so instead of redirecting the user is just shown the edit form again in the put route but then instead of re submitting the user re uses the url pressing enter in the url field copying and pasting bookmarking etc The user at that point decides to change locale happens often because the error message is the first time the person actually needs to understand the web site so they decide to switch language to one that they understand which of course generates a get in the same URL I now having a plain redirection wouldn t be the best in the second case because the error is lost but at least it s better than a 404,routes
I ve recently had a breakthrough on the coding for my skee ball style game I was having serious issues with collision detection which the boffins of stackoverflow have helped me solve I was coding a tween for my object a ball to create a smooth roll effect because I hadn t been able to get it to move smoothly otherwise I finally had a eureka moment and managed to make the object move incrementally instead of teleporting and was able to eliminate my tween Without a tween collision detection was working properly But I still have some issues First how do I get gravity friction to apply to the ball so that it doesn t come to a stop in a non collision or scoring area when it otherwise runs out of steam Two how can I make it collide properly with the boundaries so it reverses course at a proper rate And three slightly unrelated but still a major challenge so I ll mention it now if my collision areas scoring targets are aligned vertically can I put conditions in the collision detection to test for rate of speed to effectively collide with a target How can I determine that rate of speed Ok here s my current wobbly code for rolling my ball and hitting a target

coordinate calculations largely works from an effectiveness POV but the ball always seems to be removed several pixels prior to the actual collision being measures even accounting for bounding boxes as opposed to actual shapes I also attempted to turn the ball into a tween just before it was removed to make it fade away in a pretty manor but that never seemed to work And I never even tried to tackle turning the arc shaped bumpers under each target into actual collision objects that the ball could roll along if the aim was off That was just put into the too hard basket Below is my code for the collision measuring and the tweening just in case anyone has any keen insights to add Otherwise I m relatively happy with the end result called during determineScore eventfunction disappearBall

I would like to build a model where a class of ServiceRegions has a many to many relationship with zip codes That is ServiceRegions might cover multiple zip codes and they might overlap so the same zip code could be associated with multiple ServiceRegions I was hoping to store the zip code directly in a relationship table rather than creating a ZipCode class but I can t get the code to work properly I successfully got code to create relationships but I was unable to access an array of associated zips as one would expect to be able to Here s the relevant code class ServiceRegion lt ActiveRecord Base has_many z_sr_relationships dependent gt destroy foreign_key gt service_region_id has_many zips through gt z_sr_relationships source gt zip def includes_zip zip z_sr_relationships create zip_id gt zip service_region_id gt self id endendclass ZSrRelationship lt ActiveRecord Base attr_accessible service_region_id zip belongs_to service_region class_name gt ServiceRegion validates zip presence gt true validates service_region_id presence gt trueendWhen I do a show on an instance of a ServiceRegion and try to output my_service_region zips it gives me an error that it can t find the association zips Is Rails meant to let you do a many to many association with a basic type like a string or an int that s not a defined class with its own model file,many
I have an ASP NET application that uses Session SessionID to prevent multiple users viewing the same data at the same time I have a table that contains a set of images stored in BLOB that require processing Only one user is supposed to be able to view the same image at the same time To achieve this as each record is retrieved by a user the record is updated with the Session SessionID This update occurs inside a ReaderWriterLock I have done a test to ensure the ReaderWriterLock is working correctly and can confirm that only one session can execute the code inside that block at once My current theory is that two different users are getting the same SessionID at the same time A user of this application is allowed to view records they have locked or any unlocked images I have modified the application to display the SessionID in the footer of every page so that if the problem happens again I can check the SessionID value I ve seen some articles online suggesting that SessionID is not unique and some saying that the SessionID is unique I understand that SessionID is not unique forever but can the SessionID value be considered unique for active sessions This forum describes a similar problemI have also read some suggestions that a Guid should be stored in the Session object and used as a unique ID instead of the Session ID Thanks for the responses so far Here is a clarification based on the answers so far Locked forever we prevent this by a lock timeout of 5 minutes Before a user locks an image while inside the ReaderWriterLock we do a cleanup of old locks which unlocks images locked for more than 5 minutes a query to get the oldest unlocked image and an update statement to lock that image to the current session A possible cause of the problem would be if one user locks an image but then leaves the PC for a short break If they did nothing for 5 minutes that image on there screen would be unlocked and potentially opened by another user I mentioned this scenario when the problem was reported and I was assured that the users had been working continuously Different Window Tab I haven t actually seen the error with my own eyes but the person who reported the problem has told me that it is two different PC s and two different usernames of the logged in user Hopefully now that I am displaying the Session ID on the page next time it happens I will be able to say with certainty whether it is the same Session ID on two machines or if it is some other problem This issue has never occurred during the testing phase so it appears to be a symptom of a larger number of concurrent users Thanks for the responses so far and I will update this question as more information comes to hand It seems that the user didn t give me the full story Session ID is unique in our case as per the accepted answer Two users were able to see the same image at the same time because user 1 was idle for the 5 minute abandoned image unlock process The abandoned image timeout has been raised to match the session timeout to avoid this problem,state

Previously I asked about running model and view in different threads and now I understand how it poses a problem To circumvent the problem I was thinking of duplication of data When data is modified by the worker thread it simultaneously sends an update to GUI Model thread to update the model with the same data so there exist a exact copy of data with the GUI model Does this sound like a plausible approach Other method is to use direct widgets with default models like QTableWidget etc but then I need to do a lot of things that are powered by QTableView by default Please suggest,qtablewidget

I need to monitor security event logs on very busy domain controllers which generate hundreds of them each minute I know how to use EventLog EventLogEntry and EvenLogEntryCollection to open and read a server s event log but an EvenLogEntryCollection can contain 300 000 events and it wraps around continuously and very fast so I can t rely on its index to find new entries So far the only thing I was able to come up with is saving the timestamp of the last processed log entry and then iterate above the EventLogEntryCollection until I find an EventLogEntry which TimeGenerated properties is greater than the timestamp I saved but it s terribly slow to iterate on 300 000 entries to find the new ones How can I quickly find the new entries in an big event log Edit I forgot to mention I need to do this remotely not on the DC itself,log

Like we all know it s not that easy to break from a nested loop out of an outer loop without either a goto Example code another condition check in the outer loop Example code putting both loops in an extra function and returning instead of breaking Example code Though you gotta admit all of those are kinda clumsy Especially the function version lacks because of the missing context where the loops are called as you d need to pass everything you need in the loops as parameters Additionally the second one gets worse for each nested loop So I personally still consider the goto version to be the cleanest Now thinking all C 0x and stuff the third option brought me this idea utilizing lambda expressions include lt iostream gt bool CheckCondition return true bool CheckOtherCondition return false int main amp while CheckCondition for if CheckOtherCondition return do stuff do stuff std cout lt lt yep broke out of it n Example at Ideone This allows for the semantic beauty of a simple return that the third option offers while not suffering from the context problems and being nearly as clean as the goto version It s also even shorter character wise than any of the above options Now I ve learned to keep my joy down after finding beautiful ab uses of the language because there s almost always some kind of drawback Are there any on this one Or is there even a better approach to the problem,nested

I am currently working on a project that is very new to me and I feel a bit over my head as far as knowledge base is concerned My request is for references and information to help me expand my knowledge base as well as recommendations for technologies and methods I have experience primarily with Java so all this Windows service stuff is new to me I am not really asking for a how to but if someone has time I wouldn t object P The project is as follows I am to develop an application in ASP NET that runs as a process from start up to shutdown It will be checking some things in a folder encrypting some files from that folder and then check if internet connectivity is available If it is available it will be sending those files to a server via a web service on that server I believe If it is not available it will check every insert time interval here to see if connectivity has become available at which time it will send the files Once the files are received by the service the application will need to recieve some kind of confirmation from the server that the file associated with xxxxxxxxxxxxx uniqueidentifier has been received Any explanation of the way that web services work or how to implement file encryption in a desktop app resource load optimization is a very substantial requirement of this app Thanks badPanda,services

I have a remote server which handles various different commands one of which is an event fetching method The event fetch returns right away if there is 1 or more events listed in the queue ready for processing If the event queue is empty this method does not return until a timeout of a few seconds This way I don t run into any HTTP socket timeouts The moment an event becomes available the method returns right away This way the client only ever makes connections to the server and the server does not have to make any connections to the client This event mechanism works nicely I m using the boost library to handle queues event notifications etc Here s the problem While the server is holding back on returning from the event fetch method during that time I can t issue any other commands In the source code XmlRpcDispatch cpp I m seeing in the work method a simple loop that uses a blocking call to select Seems like while the handling of a method is busy no other requests are processed Question am I not seeing something and can XmlRpcpp xmlrpc handle multiple requests asynchronously Does anyone know of a better xmlrpc library for C I don t suppose the Boost library has a component that lets me issue remote commands I actually don t care about the XML or over HTTP feature I simply need to issue asynchronous commands over TCP in any shape or form I look forward to any input anyone might offer,rpc

I m planning on creating a sandbox system of a production rails app for potential clients to mess around with The production system is continuously being updated with new content which I d like to bring over to the sandbox to make it as real as possible However I don t want to nuke the sandbox by doing a full db dump restore as I d like to preserve the user accounts on this system just update with the new content I ve checked out a couple of options but I could use some advice 1 DB Dump RestoreWhile it s simple in terms of how it works it s a bit of a pain to configure with cron jobs and transferring the whole db between servers even though I may not need it I guess I can just dump certain tables but this will still probably transfer more data than required 2 DB ReplicationSetting up master slave replication on a per table basis From what I can see this might be want I want to do Replicate just the new content tables and ignore account tables 3 Another way I m not sure is there a better way to be doing this But wait there s more The sandbox system is not always running it s only available during certain hours so I need something that won t get too upset if it can t connect Just quietly fail and try again later I m pretty new to replication so does anyone have a recommandation of where to get started Slony I Bucardo rubyrep DetailsRails 3 appPostgreSQL DBUbuntu server,database

I m having a problem with OpenCV s various parameterization of coordinates used for camera calibration purposes The problem is that three different sources of information on image distortion formulae apparently give three non equivalent description of the parameters and equations involved 1 In their book Learning OpenCVâ Bradski and Kaehler write regarding lens distortion page 376 xcorrected x 1 k1 r 2 k2 r 4 k3 r 6 2 p1 x y p2 r 2 2 x 2 ycorrected y 1 k1 r 2 k2 r 4 k3 r 6 p1 r 2 2 y 2 2 p2 x y where r sqrt x 2 y 2 Assumably x y are the coordinates of pixels in the uncorrected captured image corresponding to world point objects with coordinates X Y Z camera frame referenced for whichxcorrected fx X Z cx and ycorrected fy Y Z cy where fx fy cx and cy are the camera s intrinsic parameters So having x y from a captured image we can obtain the desired coordinates xcorrected ycorrected to produced an undistorted image of the captured world scene by applying the above first two correction expressions However 2 The complication arises as we look at OpenCV 2 0 C Reference entry under the Camera Calibration and 3D Reconstruction section For ease of comparison we start with all world point X Y Z coordinates being expressed with respect to the camera s reference frame just as in 1 Consequently the transformation matrix R t is of no concern In the C reference it is expressed that x X Z y Y Z x x 1 k1 r 2 k2 r 4 k3 r 6 2 p1 x y p2 r 2 2 x 2 y y 1 k1 r 2 k2 r 4 k3 r 6 p1 r 2 2 y 2 2 p2 x y where r sqrt x 2 y 2 and finally thatu fx x cx v fy y cy As one can see these expressions are not equivalent to those presented in 1 with the result that the two sets of corrected coordinates xcorrected ycorrected and u v are not the same Why the contradiction It seems to me the first set makes more sense as I can attach physical meaning to each and every x and y in there while I find no physical meaning in x X Z and y Y Z when the camera focal length is not exactly 1 Furthermore one cannot compute x and y for we don t know X Y Z 3 Unfortunately things get even murkier when we refer to the writings in Intel s Open Source Computer Vision Library Reference Manual s section Lens Distortion page 6 4 which states in part Let u v be true pixel image coordinates that is coordinates with ideal projection and u Ì v Ì be corresponding real observed distorted image coordinates Similarly x y are ideal distortion free and x Ì y Ì are real distorted image physical coordinates Taking into account two expansion terms gives the following x Ì x 1 k1 r 2 k2 r 4 2 p1 x y p2 r 2 2 x 2 y Ì y 1 k1 r 2 k2 r 4 2 p2 x y p2 r 2 2 y 2 where r sqrt x 2 y 2 Because u Ì cx fx u and v Ì cy fy v â the resultant system can be rewritten as follows u Ì u u â cx k1 r 2 k2 r 4 2 p1 y p2 r 2 x 2 x v Ì v v â cy k1 r 2 k2 r 4 2 p2 x p1 r 2 y 2 y The latter relations are used to undistort images from the camera Well it would appear that the expressions involving x Ì and y Ì coincided with the two expressions given at the top of this writing involving xcorrected and ycorrected However x Ì and y Ì do not refer to corrected coordinates according to the given description I don t understand the distinction between the meaning of the coordinates x Ì y Ì and u Ì v Ì or for that matter between the pairs x y and u v From their descriptions it appears their only distinction is that x Ì y Ì and x y refer to physical coordinates while u Ì v Ì and u v do not What is this distinction all about Aren t they all physical coordinates I m lost Thanks for any input,calibration
I need to place two ovals in a JFrame Every oval is in a different inner class The thing is that with BorderLayout when using CENTER it allows you to span all over the frame However I cannot add the second oval as it is overwritten on the first one What layout manager can I use to have these two ovals both painted on the whole screen These are going to be animated and thus might end up going on top of each other so I need them both to be drawn on the whole screen Edit Oval is a JPanel so I have two JPanels with 2 different ovals starting at different positions I tried using BoxLayout like so mainPanel new JPanel mainPanel setLayout new BoxLayout mainPanel BoxLayout PAGE_AXIS mainPanel add drawPanel1 mainPanel add drawPanel2 frame getContentPane add BorderLayout CENTER mainPanel However as soon as the oval passes through the center it disappears as one panel is taking the top half of the screen while the other is taking the bottom half of the screen Other than that it is working fine The only thing I need is to fix the layout as for both of them to take up all the screen I also tried the GridLayout with 1 row and 1 column but still this didn t fill up the whole frame,jpanel
I have to rebuild 2 Linux domain controllers to windows as they re not working and have lots of issues Also the company has changed hands and requires a new domain name anyway I ve rebuilt one with WinServer03My question is if I give the Windows box a new IP and Domain name will it affect clients currently on the network on the old domain If they re not pointed at it they shouldn t have any trouble should they So if I build this new domain along side the linux one with new DNS server and a fresh I P i can migrate users over with minimum hassle It s probably very easy just don t wanna bring the whole deck of cards down during working hours,domain

I m building a page creator with templates in my content management system and I m going to be implementing the scriptaculous in place editor control for updating page content within the templates Before I write the code to do what I want I thought I d see if anybody has already done it or has seen alternate versions of the control to accomplish what I want Essentially I d like to be able to have the text field of the in place editor mirror the styling of the text that is being clicked on so that it looks like a true in place edit without looking like a form control I ve done this before on a per in place editor basis but I m wanting to have a solution that will automatically match the stylings For example let s say I have the following CSS html code sub title font size 12px color 333 margin bottom 15px lt div id header gt lt p class sub title gt Lorem Ipsum Sit Dolor Amet lt p gt lt div gt I m trying to avoid having to use something like header inplaceeditor form input font size 12px color 333 margin bottom 15px within the context of each editable area There will be quite a few and each template will be different So ideally I d like to avoid doing this for every control and just match it on the fly Obviously I can do things like remove borders and background color of all of the in place editors as a whole but I m trying to cut down on individual styling Presently my plan is to modify the Ajax InPlaceEditor createEditField method to look at the stylings of the element being edited and apply the styles at that point But there may be a better solution Thoughts,edit

I am currently developing a database storage solution for product inventory information for the company I work for I am using MySql and I am having a hard time coming up with an efficient feasible format for the data storage As it works right now we have 25000 products to keep track of For each product there are about 20 different categories that we need to track information for quantity available price etc This report is downloaded and updated every 3 4 days and it is stored and updated in excel right now My problem is that the only solution I have come up with so far is to create separate tables for each one of the categories mentioned above using foreign keys based off of the product skus and cascading to update each respective table However this method would require that every table add 24000 rows each time the program is run given that each product needs updated for the date it was run The problem with this is that the data will be store for around a year so the tables will grow an extensive amount My research for other database formats has yielded some examples but none on the scale of this They are geared towards adding maybe 100 rows a day Does anybody know or have any ideas of a suitable way to set up this kind of database or is the method I described above suitable and within the limitations of the MySql tables Thanks Mike,schema

I m currently building a Web API and have a specific scenario that I cannot determine which HTTP Status Code would be most appropriate to return The ScenarioI have a client resource which owns a collection of contact resources The invariant is that a client must always have at least one contact Therefore if a request is made to delete a contact and this contact is the last remaining contact for the given client I need to return an appropriate HTTP response indicating that the request cannot be fulfilled as you Cannot Delete the last contact My feeling is this should fall under the category of 4xx Client Error s I ve considered the following Status Codes 400 Bad Request I ve ruled this out as it s specifically regarding malformed request s in which the server is unable to understand 405 Method Not Allowed at first this seems suitable but I think 405 indicates that this method should never be allowed however the above scenario is only transient Thoughts 409 Conflict I ve been leaning towards this however the common example given for this code is generally a concurrency exception edit conflict Does anyone have any guidance as to how I should respond in this scenario,web

This is a similar pattern to ones stated elsewhere and detailed in this blog post I have this working using Windsor 2 5 4 pretty much as stated in the blogpost but decided to switch to using Windsor 3 When I did this I noticed that the memory usage of the application go up over time I guessed this would be that components were nt being released There were a couple of modifications to the code in the blogpost which may have caused the behaviour to differ Here is my AutoRelease interceptor straight out of the blogpost here for convenience and the lazy Transient public class AutoReleaseHandlerInterceptor IInterceptor private static readonly MethodInfo Execute typeof IDocumentHandler GetMethod Process private readonly IKernel _kernel public AutoReleaseHandlerInterceptor IKernel kernel _kernel kernel public void Intercept IInvocation invocation if invocation Method Execute invocation Proceed return try invocation Proceed finally _kernel ReleaseComponent invocation Proxy One of my deviations from the blog post is the selector that the typed factory uses public class ProcessorSelector DefaultTypedFactoryComponentSelector protected override Func lt IKernelInternal IReleasePolicy object gt BuildFactoryComponent MethodInfo method string componentName Type componentType IDictionary additionalArguments return new MyDocumentHandlerResolver componentName componentType additionalArguments FallbackToResolveByTypeIfNameNotFound GetType Resolve protected override string GetComponentName MethodInfo method object arguments return null protected override Type GetComponentType MethodInfo method object arguments var message arguments 0 var handlerType typeof IDocumentHandler lt gt MakeGenericType message GetType return handlerType What might be noticeable is that I do not use the default resolver This is where perhaps the problem lies public class MyDocumentHandlerResolver TypedFactoryComponentResolver public override object Resolve IKernelInternal kernel IReleasePolicy scope return kernel Resolve componentType additionalArguments scope I omitted the ctor for brevity nothing special happens there it just calls the base ctor The reason I did this was because the default resolver would try to resolve by name and not by Type and fail In this case I know I only ever need to resolve by type so I just overrode the Resolve method The final piece of the puzzle will be the installer container AddFacility lt TypedFactoryFacility gt Register Component For lt AutoReleaseHandlerInterceptor gt Component For lt ProcessorSelector gt ImplementedBy lt ProcessorSelector gt Classes FromAssemblyContaining lt MessageHandler gt BasedOn typeof IDocumentHandler lt gt WithService Base Configure c gt c LifeStyle Is LifestyleType Transient Component For lt IDocumentHandlerFactory gt AsFactory c gt c SelectedWith lt ProcessorSelector gt Stepping through the code the interceptor is called and the finally clause is executed e g I didn t get the method name wrong However the component does not seem to be released using the performance counter shows this Each invocation of the factory s create method increases the counter by one So far my workaround has been to add a void Release IDocumentHandler handler method to my factory interface and then after it executes the handler Process method it explicitly releases the handler instance and this seems to do the job the performance counter goes up and as the processing is done it goes down Here is the factory public interface IDocumentHandlerFactory IDocumentHandler GetHandlerForDocument IDocument document void Release IDocumentHandler handler And here is how I use it IDocumentHandlerFactory handler _documentHandlerFactory GetHandlerForDocument document handler Process _documentHandlerFactory Release handler Doing the Release explicitly therefore negates the need for the interceptor but my real question is why this behaviour differs between the releases,facility
I would like to add some kind of traffic management to our Internet line After reading a lot of documentation I think HFSC is too complicated for me I don t understand all the curves stuff I m afraid I will never get it right CBQ is not recommend and basically HTB is the way to go for most people Our internal network has three segments and I d like to share bandwidth more or less equally between those at least in the beginning Further I must prioritize traffic according to at least three kinds of traffic realtime traffic standard traffic and bulk traffic The bandwidth sharing is not as important as the fact that realtime traffic should always be treated as premium traffic whenever possible but of course no other traffic class may starve either The question is what makes more sense and also guarantees better realtime throughput Creating one class per segment each having the same rate priority doesn t matter for classes that are no leaves according to HTB developer and each of these classes has three sub classes leaves for the 3 priority levels with different priorities and different rates Having one class per priority level on top each having a different rate again priority won t matter and each having 3 sub classes one per segment whereas all 3 in the realtime class have highest prio lowest prio in the bulk class and so on I ll try to make this more clear with the following ASCII art image Case 1 root gt Segment A gt High Prio gt Normal Prio gt Low Prio gt Segment B gt High Prio gt Normal Prio gt Low Prio gt Segment C gt High Prio gt Normal Prio gt Low PrioCase 2 root gt High Prio gt Segment A gt Segment B gt Segment C gt Normal Prio gt Segment A gt Segment B gt Segment C gt Low Prio gt Segment A gt Segment B gt Segment CCase 1 Seems like the way most people would do it but unless I don t read the HTB implementation details correctly Case 2 may offer better prioritizing The HTB manual says that if a class has hit its rate it may borrow from its parent and when borrowing classes with higher priority always get bandwidth offered first However it also says that classes having bandwidth available on a lower tree level are always preferred to those on a higher tree level regardless of priority Let s assume the following situation Segment C is not sending any traffic Segment A is only sending realtime traffic as fast as it can enough to saturate the link alone and Segment B is only sending bulk traffic as fast as it can again enough to saturate the full link alone What will happen Case 1 Segment A High Prio and Segment B Low Prio both have packets to send since A High Prio has the higher priority it will always be scheduled first till it hits its rate Now it tries to borrow from Segment A but since Segment A is on a higher level and Segment B Low Prio has not yet hit its rate this class is now served first till it also hits the rate and wants to borrow from Segment B Once both have hit their rates both are on the same level again and now Segment A High Prio is going to win again until it hits the rate of Segment A Now it tries to borrow from root which has plenty of traffic spare as Segment C is not using any of its guaranteed traffic but again it has to wait for Segment B Low Prio to also reach the root level Once that happens priority is taken into account again and this time Segment A High Prio will get all the bandwidth left over from Segment C Case 2 High Prio Segment A and Low Prio Segment B both have packets to send again High Prio Segment A is going to win as it has the higher priority Once it hits its rate it tries to borrow from High Prio which has bandwidth spare but being on a higher level it has to wait for Low Prio Segment B again to also hit its rate Once both have hit their rate and both have to borrow High Prio Segment A will win again until it hits the rate of the High Prio class Once that happens it tries to borrow from root which has again plenty of bandwidth left all bandwidth of Normal Prio is unused at the moment but it has to wait again until Low Prio Segment B hits the rate limit of the Low Prio class and also tries to borrow from root Finally both classes try to borrow from root priority is taken into account and High Prio Segment A gets all bandwidth root has left over Both cases seem sub optimal as either way realtime traffic sometimes has to wait for bulk traffic even though there is plenty of bandwidth left it could borrow However in case 2 it seems like the realtime traffic has to wait less than in case 1 since it only has to wait till the bulk traffic rate is hit which is most likely less than the rate of a whole segment and in case 1 that is the rate it has to wait for Or am I totally wrong here I thought about even simpler setups using a priority qdisc But priority queues have the big problem that they cause starvation if they are not somehow limited Starvation is not acceptable Of course one can put a TBF Token Bucket Filter into each priority class to limit the rate and thus avoid starvation but when doing so a single priority class cannot saturate the link on its own any longer even if all other priority classes are empty the TBF will prevent that from happening And this is also sub optimal since why wouldn t a class get 100 of the line s bandwidth if no other class needs any of it at the moment Any comments or ideas regarding this setup It seems so hard to do using standard tc qdiscs As a programmer it was such an easy task if I could simply write my own scheduler which I m not allowed to do,traffic

I m looking to clean up some code I have that has gotten out of control There are often situations where I need to interact with a couple of remote APIs such as Parse and Facebook perhaps Core Data while the user is waiting staring at my activity indicator spin My requirements are everything slow must be of course in a background threadno silent or ignored error messages I want to help both the user so that he doesn t freak out and myself for when I get the support call and I need to figure out what went wrong with as helpful error messages as possible I want the logic to be maintainable Chunks like the one below go up in cyclomatic complexity really fast and become a nightmare to work with if not handled properly especially with the addition of multithreading The pattern I use right now goes as void sampleFacebookProcessingCall self spinner startAnimating FBRequestConnection startForMeWithCompletionHandler FBRequestConnection connection id result NSError facebookRequestError we re back in main queue let s return to a secondary queue dispatch_async dispatch_get_global_queue DISPATCH_QUEUE_PRIORITY_HIGH 0 don t want do display the actual error to the user NSString errorMessage NSError error try if facebookRequestError errorMessage Could not connect to Facebook please try again later return Helper someParseCall amp error if error errorMessage The operation could not be completed please try again later Code FOO1 return Helper someOtherParseCall amp error if error errorMessage The operation could not be completed please try again later Code FOO2 return finally dispatch_async dispatch_get_main_queue self activityIndicator stopAnimating if errorMessage there might be half baked state out there afer the error self cleanupResources UIHelper displayErrorAlertViewWithMessage errorMessage Now there are definitely different patterns for escaping through a flow when an error occurs The try finally pattern with returns same idea as the old school goto with the cleanup label is one way Another way would be to use an error object as a should proceed variable and do something like if error doStuff amp error if error The addition of GCD complicates things a bit because now you have to make sure that the heavy work is being always done in the background and that errors are only ever reported in the main thread Every API s library does things a bit differently so you have something like Facebook which only accepts blocks to be executed in main thread which you have to interweave with Parse which allows you to run blocking calls if you wanted to I m wondering if anybody out there has come up with a cleaner approach I feel like this is something most apps end up dealing with sooner or later and I don t need to reinvent the wheel,patterns

IntroductionI m currently developing a small drawing application similar to MugTug s Sketchpad There s one pretty annoying issue I haven t managed to get around yet though Drawing AlgorithmMy basic draw algorithm is similar to the one used by MugTug Basically it just stamps images using drawImage while the user is drawing There s one serious handicap The algorithm begins to fail with low alpha You can see this easily in the MugTug s tool by setting brush settings in the following way diameter 100 hardness 1 flow 100 opacity 2 1 is too small bug in the app There are two main issues 1 Visible banding 2 Color shifts give different colors a go to see how this works QuestionsCould the issue have something to do with color precision It seems to me the Canvas API treats colors using 8 bit channels ie 0 255 Is there any way around this limitation I would prefer to use pure float colors 0 0 1 0 instead if possible Any ideas on how to deal with this are welcome If color is indeed limited to 8 bit channels I guess I m out of luck,html5
I m working on an iPad app that displays lightmapped scenes Loading the 20 or so 1Kx1K textures that are involved is taking a while and when I started timing the various operations I found it was taking slightly less than 1 2 second per texture It turns out that loading a texture image from the filesystem is pretty fast and that the bottleneck is in copying the UIImage to a CGContext in order to pass the image to a glTexImage2D I ve tried two different ways of making the copy CGContextSetInterpolationQuality textureCopyContext kCGInterpolationNone CGContextDrawImage textureCopyContext CGRectMake 0 0 width height image and UIGraphicsPushContext textureCopyContext uiImage drawInRect CGRectMake 0 0 width height UIGraphicsPopContext and both take about 0 45 seconds This strikes me as excessive even for a relatively underpowered device I m relatively new to iOS development so I just want to ask whether the times I m seeing are reasonable or whether they can be improved Update I m aware of the PVRTC alternative but for now I ve got to stick with PNGs However there is an excellent summary of the pros and cons of PVRTC in this answer The same answer also hints at why PNGs result in such long texture setup times internal pixel reordering Can anybody confirm this,es

I just got done reading this thread Best CMS for a corporate web presence Which was the closest thing I could find on the web I too am looking to redesign a website for a corporation I am the marketing director not a developer I have researched this subject in many places I won t say everywhere I have read http sunlightlabs com blog 2009 content management systems just dont work andhttp www webdesignish com the best web development frameworks htmland dabbled at www cmsmatrix org and www bestwebframeworks com under the PHP area I have read at least a few dozen articles from various places some of them including the providers websites or forums I have read nearly as much as I can in the time I gave myself so with a little knowledge on all these areas I want to reach out to a community that has more experience Background Manufacturer website one location no branches One marketing IT guy Utilizes dreamweaver for all web editing needs Knows ultra basic html only for text and image placement and editing I need to be pointed in the direction of a cost effective design solution with either a framework or combination thereof or a CMS that can give me what I need The best example of what I want the site to look like would be a cross between tripplite dot com and logitech dot com with some elements from a site like sonicwall dot com I need an animated menu system but with images so size customization is necessary Simple animations for rollovers and click reactions so that users can tell when they have selected something Page content does not change often with most edits being to PDF documents At present I name all major documents such as a 2011 catalog with the same filename and simply replace the document with the latest version via FTP Nearly every other page will be a static page with static text and images I might request polish on all other pages after the development is complete Our site might end up being somewhere around 50 pages after this redesign It has been suggested to me to have the site designed in Wordpress by a pro but everything I HAD read before reading the first mentioned thread posted here said that I shouldnt use it because of content and bug issues I believe that wordpress can provide a robust and feature rich corporate website that isn t just another blog or news site I have seen a few examples like networksolutions dot com Project 1 is a redesign and new look Project 2 9 goes through a parts library with thumbnails build to quote system similar to a shopping cart but with no payments and no PCI compliance an e page flip type catalog revision and login portals with per user entity content such as order history order documentation records and open order production status and shipping information We want it all But where to go I have so far looked at for a CMS Wordpress Drupal Radiant CMS concrete5 and spoke with Franz a tad and synType CMS To go the framework route with PHP yii codeigniter akelos symfony prado cakephp and solarphpThe other ones I have heard many developers praising were jquery dojo and django but im not sure yet if they are utilized in any other solutions that I listed Tomorrow I will be going through the definitions and such at bestwebframeworks to better learn about the once I had chosen and pit them against one another I would really appreciate any help in evaluating which platform would best suit me based on the information that I have provided above Feel free to ask any other questions that may help narrow the list Thank you all in advance,content

I would like to know if a higher gc maxlifetime value will affect performance of site Let s say 2 weeks 1209600 seconds The reason i m asking is because some of my pages is taking minutes to load that were very fast before I changed the value from the default 24 minutes to 2 weeks so that users session data and login would be persistent This was about 2 weeks ago which leads me to believe that the high gc maxlifetime could be the problem for the slow pageload It s not always the same pages though PS I am in the process of moving to a cookie based persistent login system which I believe is more performance friendly Thanks,collection

Am I correct in saying that a Net Hashtable is not synchronized while a Java Hashtable is And at the same time a Java HashMap is not synchronized and has better performance I am rewriting a Java app that makes heavy use of HashMaps in C and I would like to use a HashTable and ensure that the performance is basically equivalent,hashmap
Currently I have a construct that does the following An X number of threads X being a configurable variable from the user are all started and await for a task to become available The threads block waiting in a BlockingQueue Another thread s places task s in the blocking queue and the blocked threads take the task s and run them and go back to wait for the next task Anyway this works fine but I have the following issue X threads are constantly waiting for a task even if there isn t any for 2 hours Also X threads are actually available even if there are only lets say X 50 tasks coming in i e I have much more threads than I actually need So my question is how could I refactor this perhaps using Executors so that X goes up and down as needed My aim is not to lose performance I mean now I could have more threads than I would need wasting resources but I don t have the overhead of creating new threads I am interested in refactoring this in a way to not waste resources and keep the same performance levels,java

I have a 64 bit Windows 2003 server with 48 CPU cores and 128GB of RAM running a single application SQL 2008 Analysis Services SSAS is currently using about 50GB of memory SSAS relies to a large extent on the Windows File Cache to hold frequently used data see this article for example On my server the windows file cache is normally in the 10 15GB range but occasionally it will suddenly drop to 5 6GB Memory System Cache Resident Bytes When this occurs all the SSAS page reads have to go to disk and queries start timing out until the file cache repopulates I have a second server only 24 cores but otherwise near identical that doesn t exhibit the same symptoms even running the exact same SSAS instance the same queries and the same load this is a load balanced environment I ve asked a detailed SSAS focused question on dba stackexchange com but a few questions about the Windows behavior Is there a way to know why the SSAS database file is getting flushed out of the cache Can I pre populate the file cache or actively manage it in some way I m not sure that using a RAMDRIVE is an option in our environment At one point we did change the network optimization setting on the server to Maximize data throughput for file sharing to match the other box but that hasn t seemed to make a significant difference Edit Added bounty If we can t answer why then perhaps just a way to better understand what processes are currently using the cache or what files are in it or something that might lead us in the right direction,server

I am currently working on a GWT application that requires reportprinting The use can select report parameters from a screen andupon clicking print we would like to display the file as it is beinggenerated Currently we have server side code that is generating HTMLand writing it to a file When the user clicks print an RPC is beingmade to pass the report parameters to the server and begin thereport A second RPC is made after the report has started to obtainthe report s URL From here we are creating a Frame and setting theURL to be the URL retrieved by the second RPC The issue I am running into is that when setUrl getscalled it only displays as much HTML that was contained in the fileat the time of the call What would be the best way to refresh justthe frame containing the HTML report It appears making subsequentcalls to setUrl passing in the same Url each time would do the trick but it actually doesn t seem to contain the additional content thatwould ve been written since the last call It is also resetting thevertical scroll bar s position each time back to the top of the barwhich is something else I would like to prevent Is there a better way to go about doing this,sencha

I am wiring a startup script JavaScript function on Page_Load to fire like so ScriptManager RegisterStartupScript Me GetType Page page_init page_init True This function calls a couple of different functions to setup the page One of those functions checks the document readyState and makes sure it s complete This deals with images and I want to make sure everything has been fully rendered if document readyState complete Everything works fine until I need to write a byte array to the outputstream using either Response BinaryWrite or Response OutputStream Write to give a file to a user After that the document readyState is always interactive until I navigate off of the page and back I have even used a setTimeout myFunction 1000 call if document readyState isn t complete to recursively call the function until it is complete It never reaches complete I have researched this myself for quite sometime and cannot figure out this behavior Any ideas as to how this is happening,javascript
Is there any type of emulation software like VirtualBox VMWare etc that supports seamless mode on multiple monitors I saw the other question but the answer involves connecting to the windows machine with RDP which I don t want to do Is there any other way If not for what reason does it not work From what I understand about computers it doesn t seem like it should make a difference whether it would work on 2 monitors vs 1 monitor,pc
I have created a bunch of widgets with QT designer What I would like to know is if these widgets can be used drag and dropped with other components I create with QT Designer without having to export them and compile them as a custom widget since it seems that the ui file already contains most of that functionality that I would be exporting with the custom widget interface Is this possible or am I thinking about how components created with the Qt Designer can work together wrong Thanks all,designer
I saw Adobe Lightroom on my friend s computer and it seems awfully complex to me Basically he was adjusting color palette of the photo by changing some curves and moving sliders I noticed that many settings overlapped each other but I got completely lost because I couldn t understand why my friend picked one setting over the other He said that it s something I would just get used to but right now I m totally puzzled What are basic tips to getting started to use such software Should I just play or should I progress from one setting to the next,tips

I have discounts running on items if they are bought in a group If one buys A B C categories they get a 10 discount and say they pick B C D categories they get a 15 discount But what happens now is say there is A B C D in the cart it becomes 2 rules A B C and B C D whereas it should be just 1 I cannot set the Stop further rule processing as Yes because then my users cannot buy 2 combos of exclusive itemsSo I need to exclude the items which have already become a part of one shopping rule Similarly say I have a discount of 5 on purchase of A B then picking 1 piece of A and 2 pieces of B gives a user 2 discounts,1
So we have a few classes with custom type converters TypeConverter typeof FooTypeConverter public struct Foo stuff public class FooTypeConverter TypeConverter public override yadda yadda and the Net code that uses it looks similar to this TypeConverter converter TypeDescriptor GetConverter typeof Foo if converter CanConvertFrom value GetType outValue converter ConvertFrom value return true This works fine from Net All our Net based unit tests pass yadda yadda All the Net code that uses the library works fine The problem however is when the library is used from inside a VB6 application the call to TypeDescriptor GetConverter typeof Foo returns a System ComponentModel TypeConverter rather than the proper FooTypeConverter Any ideas Edit I should also point out the code containing this is not directly referenced by the VB6 code The legacy code calls a COM Visible wrapper which exposes all the com friendly types that should be required to use the library,conversion

I am new to MVC so this question may be naiveI know you can add validation attributes to model properties and the framework will provide appropriate server side and client side validation However I am forced to use a legacy database structure where one of the properties in the model is either int or string and the other property Value data type is determined by the first property This means that I cannot use Annotations for validation But is there any simple way of programatically annotating the properties after values are fetched from the database and the model class is constructed If this can be done then it will do effective client Side validation without much hassle thanks,mvc
My site is available at http www innexdesign co uk dev The site works perfectly in IE and most pages are also fine in Firefox and Chrome However if we navigate to the Designs Menu and hover down the choices Designs for Drinking Designs for Eating etc you see the logo and fitter divs appear to move a bit further down as you hover over them Similarly if you were to select Designs for drinking and hover over the individual pubs you would again see the logo and footer divs appear to move down the page as you hover over them This also happens in Designs for Eating Designs for Housing and Designs

I m building a web application that interacts heavily with the DOM and need direction in making my code scalable and maintainable The application overview Upon interaction I have toolbars and overlays that guide the user to edit the page I then send back the edited page to the server So far I ve successfully built what I wanted but it s JQuery all tied together and I need help on how to rewrite my code to make it scalable and maintainable Research so far RequireJS I ve looked at RequireJS and thought this was a great starting point and got it all working JQuery Can t get away from this awesome library Nicholas Zakas presentation on Scalable JavaScript Application Architecture Awesome idea but how do I implement this I m fairly new to advanced JavaScript I will also need some kind of event pooling to manage all these events If I use JQuery s built in event pooling bind trigger will this not force me away from Zakas idea that only my application core should have access to my JQuery library What type of framework should I be looking at to solve my problem,javascript

I am getting a real fast realtime stream of data points between 0 and 1 and need to sort them into buckets Assume there is a 0 6 coming and my buckets cover an area of 0 25 each This would mean 0 6 goes into the third bucket However when there are a lot numbers around 0 6 coming they will all end up in bucket three which is bad I want to change the areas covered by the four buckets such that each bucket has an equal probability of being hit For example it might be better to make bucket one cover 0 0 5 the second one 0 5 0 6 thirs one 0 6 0 65 and the last one 0 65 1 The problem is I can not store the values only which buckets are hit how often So is there a working update formula for this Thank you very much in advance,probability

I have a low power server with 4 ethernet sockets It was running Fedora 11 with 3 of the network sockets named eth0 eth1 and eth2 the final network socket was not in use it was eth3 but don t know for sure that it actually worked I installed Ubuntu Server 10 04 on it this morning While it was installing it recognised eth0 and used it to access the internet Now it doesn t It recognises eth1 as being eth1 and claims there is an eth5 somewhere but doesn t recognise any other interfaces from eth0 eth7 I require 3 working ethernet sockets I would like my ethernet sockets named eth0 eth3 as they were under Fedora How do I make that happen Why have they been renamed in the first place Ethernet sockets have always popped up with the names I was expecting before so I don t know where to start There is some inconsistency in the hardware addresses three of the ethernet ports claim to have Sometimes they claim to be at xx xx xx xx xx xx at other times they claim to be at 00 00 00 00 xx xx As far as I can tell they never change hardware address when the OS is active only when the machine is switched off or possibly when rebooting I don t know where I go from here Each ethernet port consistently has one of two hardware addresses they re just inconsistent about which one they re using at any given time I tried telling udev that both hardware addresses belong to the same ethernet port I expected that udev would complain at this but it accepts it and uses the hardware address that is present for that port So my problem seems to be solved,ethernet

I am having a little problem I wrote a program that extracts a set of three dimensional points in each frame using a camera and depth information The points are in the camera coordinate system which means the origin is at the camera center x is horizontal distance y vertical distance and z the distance from the camera along the optical axis Everything is in meters I e point 2 1 5 would be two meters right one meter below and five meters along the optical axis of the camera I calculate these points in each time frame and also know the correspondences like I know which point in t 1 belongs to which 3d point in t My goal now is to calculate the motion of the camera in each time frame in my world coordinate system with z pointing up representing the height I would like to calculate relative motion but also the absolute one starting from some start position to visualize the trajectory of the camera This is an example data set of one frame with the current left and the previous 3D location right of the points in camera coordinates 0 174004 0 242901 3 672510 0 089167 0 246231 3 646694 0 265066 0 079420 3 668801 0 182261 0 075341 3 634996 0 092708 0 459499 3 673029 0 179553 0 459284 3 636645 0 593070 0 056592 3 542869 0 675082 0 051625 3 509424 0 676054 0 517077 3 585216 0 763378 0 511976 3 555986 0 555625 0 350790 3 496224 0 633524 0 354710 3 465260 1 189281 0 953641 3 556284 1 274754 0 938846 3 504309 0 489797 0 933973 3 435228 0 561585 0 935864 3 404614 Since I would like to work with OpenCV if possible I found the estimateAffine3D function in OpenCV 2 3 which takes two 3D point input vectors and calculates the affine transformation between them using RANSAC As output I get a 3x4 transformation matrix I already tried to make the calculation more accurate by setting the RANSAC parameters but a lot of times the trnasformation matrix shows a translatory movement that is quite big As you can see in the sample data the movement is usually quite small So I wanted to ask if anybody has another idea on what I could try Does OpenCV offer other solutions for this Also if I have the relative motion of the camera in each timeframe how would I convert it to world coordinates Also how would I then get the absolute position starting from a point 0 0 0 so I have the camera position and direction for each time frame Would be great if anybody could give me some advice Thank you UPDATE 1 After Michael Kupchick nice answer I tried to check how well the estimateAffine3D function in OpenCV works So I created two little test sets of 6 point pairs that just have a translation not a rotation and had a look at the resulting transformation matrix Test set 1 1 5 2 1 6 7 0 5 1 1 5 76 7 4 5 12 4 5 7 3 5 11 43 5 3 2 1 2 2 5 2 2 0 2 10 2 5 5 5 5 11 2 4 5 4 5 7 2 2 2 6 5 8 2 3 2 5 5 2 2 7 3 19 2 3 2 8 3 18 2Transformation Matrix 1 1 0573e 16 6 4096e 17 1 1 3633e 16 1 2 59504e 16 13 20342e 09 1 14395e 09 1 1Test set 2 1 5 2 1 0 0 5 1 1 06 7 4 5 0 5 7 3 5 03 5 3 2 0 2 5 2 2 0 10 2 5 5 0 11 2 4 5 0 7 2 2 2 0 8 2 3 2 0 2 2 7 3 0 3 2 8 3 0Transformation Matrix 1 4 4442e 17 0 1 2 69695e 17 1 0 10 0 0 0 This gives me two transformation matrices that look right at first sight Assuming this is right how would I recalculate the trajectory of this when I have this transformation matrix in each timestep Anybody any tips or ideas why it s that bad,motion

I have a web application which allows users to upload files and share them with other people across the internet Anyone who has access can download the files but if the uploader doesn t specifically share the file with someone else that person can t download the files Since the user permissions are controlled by rails each time someone tries to download a file it sent to the user from a rails process This is a serious bottle neck rails is needed for the file upload and permissions but it shouldn t be in the way taking up memory just for others to download files I would like to split the application on different servers for the frontend database and file server If the user does to my site they should have the ability to download the file directly from something like my fileserver domain com file 38183 instead of running it through rails What is the best option for this I would like to control file access at the database level not the file system but I don t want rails taking up all of the memory on my system for such a simple process Any ideas Edit One thing I may be able to do is load a list of files permissions from mysql into a node js app and give access rights to the file server as a true false response based on what the file server sends in This still requires the file server to run a web server however,ubuntu
What is the best practice about xml deserialization in ActionScript 3 I m developing a real time multiplayer Facebook game I prefered writing client side with Flash Beside server side is written with Java Communication between server and client is provided with socket Server and client sends xml to each other As might be expected those Xmls contains objects which are derived from classes located in both side Class names and attributes are synchronised Turning to the my issue I ve tried some libraries for serialization and deserialization at actionscript side But most of them doesn t work completely For example Asx3mer instance fromXML xmlObj This library doesn t convert xml into object which has an Array attribute and that array contains another array I mean nested array Could you help me to handle this problem Thanks At first I choosed json for automatic serialization But when I deserialized the json object it s converted to a object having class type Object At every turn I was obliged to put an identifier in json string in order to handle its type I ve researched AMF but as you ve mentioned AMF use its messaging standart and I thought it might be hard to handle deserializing objects at server side But now my choice shows that client side deserialization got unwieldy,deserialization

helloi have an educational software that should be installed on different PCs across the enterprise my program is using a 5000 text xml html files as source of it s content i don t want my source to be tampered with copied or used illegally what i intend to do is to encrypt my source seperately and then put the encrypted files in a folder inside of my app so later my app can read and decrypt each file that is requested by user the app will be installed and used anywhere but the problem is that to secure and store the encryption key inside my application i have to use a key container while as far as i remember correct me if i m wrong they re machine based and can t be used on different machines while i need my key to be fixed for all the installed copies on any PC i know a lot of softwares using such a architecture but i don t know how do they do that any idea,code

This may be a heretic question in a way We have large site where lot of pages are still in ASP Mostly there are not really dynamic but they include via SSI or Server Execute periodically regenerated chunks of HTML It may look like a poor man s caching but it has been working really well and I m guessing that Microsoft has heavily optimized IIS for this scenario Now we would like to be able achieve something similar in ASP NET ASP NET MVC We will have periodically generated HTML snippets typically hourly or so which we would like to include into ASP NET ASP NET MVC wrappers providing the main site chrome some navigation and possibly some other dynamic content related to the snippets So it s a mixture but the point is that the generated HTML are periodically re generated by an external process mainly for performance reasons and keeping our server farm in sync The closest thing in ASP NET I was able to find was lt Response WriteFile GeneratedSnippet inc gt which seems to be equivalent to the lt Server Execute GeneratedSnippet inc gt in ASP It s perhaps even faster because there is no code to execute But it s not perhaps as efficient as lt include file GeneratedSnippet inc gt As I mentioned above I suspect that IIS has been heaving optimized to handle SSI as well as ASP includes over the years On the other hand the Response WriteFile most likely really reads the file and spits it out Would anybody have an insight into two or some experience Maybe I worry too much but most of our traffic heavy content still runs on ASP and uses lot of SSI s and so even a little difference in Response WriteFile may accumulate and have a visible impact,mvc

I m working on a small hobby project of mine where I have a big structure that takes care of all core tasks This core won t do much by itself it needs a dozen subsystems that actually do the hard work I ve currently written only one subsystem so it s still easy to change things I have a lot of code locations where the core interfaces with the subsystems and I don t want to have to change the core every time I add a new subsystem My idea was to make it modular A long time I saw something similar in a game engine where a new console command could be defined by using some preprocessor macro That was all you had to do after compiling it instantly worked in the game So let s take the game engine as an example for my case I ve placed comments in the code below that should make my question more obvious My question How do I implement a modular system in Objective C that s built at compile time and does not involve changing anything other than the modules themselves And now some code void interpretCommand NSString command Find the space in the command NSRange pos command rangeOfString if pos length 0 return No space found NSString theCommand command substringToIndex pos location Here comes the important code Get all the available commands this is what my question is about NSDictionary allCommands nil Find the command in the dictionary NSString foundCommand allCommands objectForKey theCommand Execute the command if foundCommand nil NSClassFromString foundCommand new execute I want to be able to add a new command with something like REGISTER_COMMAND MyClassName theCommand Remember the above code isn t my specific case Also I don t want external modules they have to be compiled as if they were implemented natively Objective C is fine so is C or C UpdateClarification I know how to do this with a plist file but if I chose that I might just as well store them in my actual code I m looking for a C C Objective C solution that allows me to simply add the module with a preprocessor macro Update 2Adding a bounty I d really like some good ideas for this,modularity
This is a problem i have with data that i receive from a library that has some Async operations on sending and receiving data While i receive data and get data in my Mobile Windows Form or Desktop i need to deal with the cross thread operation I deal with this while checking InvokeRequired and do Action if true etc But what i really would like is to make this disappear and get my data correctly so i could bind them manipulate etc without handling this cross thread problem Question is How can i manipulate data into my library and then raise the event to the client Where they could whatever they want without deal cross thread handling This must be valid for Compact Framework too cause clients are Mobile Clients And that s why a solution found using ISynchronizeInvoke is not valid Any help to make this nice appreciated Thanks in advance,asynchronous
According to Chapter 3 2 of the PostScript Language Reference there are three encodings for the PostScript language ASCII binary token and binary object sequence We ve been generating PDF files from HTML CSS with PrinceXML for quite some time Recently a new requirement arose in cooperation with another company that needs the contents of our PDF files as Postscript When converting the PDF to PS via the command line by using pdf2ps pdftops a2ping or others the resulting PS files seem to have one of the binary encodings as there s no way to search for text We re delivering the PS file few days prior to printing and don t know the printing date beforehand but as a requirement the printing date needs to be printed Therefore we need to insert a date placeholder which they will automatically replace when printing If we insert that placeholder in our HTML CSS representation it can t be searched in the contents of the postscript file and therefore not replaced with the current date prior to printing Does anyone know a way to convert the PDF to ASCII PostScript so the contained text can be searched and replaced,postscript
I have a Samba server configured in my PC When other PCs in LAN download data from the server top command shows smbd occupies 75 CPU While they transfer data to the server top command shows smbd occupies 30 CPU I guess this is because for data receiving the server does not need to compute the header or the checksum Are there any more precise explanation to this Another question is why smbd does not occupy more CPU Because the connection in my LAN is 1Gbit and the rate for both directions only reach 90Mbit s So why not smbd takes more CPU to reach higher rate During the receiving profiling results show that the CPU even have about 30 time with nothing to do at all default_idle Mircea VutcoviciThe test file is a 690MB avi Samba version is 3 0 24 The file system is FAT and the file is stored in a USB2 0 external hard disk 200Mbit s There is no offload engine CPU spend most its time in kernel space for example smbd consumes 75 where about 40 is consumed by Linux network stack Sendfile is activated but without SG support so actually it is tcp_sendmsg used instead of tcp_sendpage,transfer

Currently I am developing application for the Windows Store which does real time image processing using Direct2D It must support various sizes of images The first problem I have faced is how to handle the situations when the image is larger than the maximum supported texture size After some research and documentation reading I found the VirtualSurfaceImageSource as a solution The idea was to load the image as IWICBitmap then to create render target with CreateWICBitmapRenderTarget which as far as I know is not hardware accelerated After some drawing operations I wanted to display the result to the screen by invalidating the corresponding region in the VirtualSurfaceImage source or when the NeedUpdate callback fires I supposed that it is possible to do it by creating ID2D1Bitmap hardware accelerated and to call CopyFromRenderTarget with the render target created with CreateWICBitmapRenderTarget and the invalidated region as bounds but the method returns D2DERR_WRONG_RESOURCE_DOMAIN as a result Another reason for using IWICBitmap is one of the algorithms involved in the application which must have access to update the pixels of the image The question is why this logic doesn t work Is this the right way to achieve my goal using Direct2D Also as far as the render target created with CreateWICBitmapRenderTarget is not hardware accelerated if I want to do my image processing on the GPU with images larger than the maximum allowed texture size which is the best solution Thank you in advance,8

I m having a problem with Thunderbird and I can t for the life of me figure out what the problem is I m usingOS X 10 6 7Thunderbird 3 1 10 I have it configured to check 3 IMAP google accounts one of which sees massive amounts of traffic the account I use for mailing lists I mention the high traffic volume because I suspect it is closely related to the problem The problem is this Thunderbird regularly and without warning locks up pinning one of my CPUs and going completely unresponsive for a period of anywhere between 5 45 seconds I ve found that the best way to reproduce this bug is first configure 3 mail accounts one with around 1 9Gigs of emails no attachments just regular emails then simply click Write to open a new email dialogue Within 10 seconds Thunderbird and the new Write window locks up becoming unresponsive You can continue to type as you normally would but characters are just held in the buffer until Thunderbird comes back at which point it catches up on everything you typed I ve tried checking the Activity Monitor while writing a new email to see if anything shows up but nothing does The only way I know how to get it to not lockup like that is to disconnect from the internet while I m composing the email But that s really only a temporary fix that really only applies to writing emails and this lockup problem rears it s ugly head even when I m browsing my email in my inbox I switched from Apple Mail to Thunderbird for the OpenPGP plugin something Apple Mail still doesn t support natively to the best of my knowledge so I can t switch back I remember Apple Mail didn t have this problem though so I m considering using Apple Mail for anything not requiring signing encrypting but I d really like to figure out and fix what Thunderbird is choking on It s Open Source after all,lockup

There have been 2 instances now where the Script checkbox under IIS Sites Site Handler Mappings Edit Feature Permissions has become unchecked What could possibly be causing this to occur Haven t been able to find any information online about others experiencing this problem This could just be a coincidence but I just realized that this has happened twice now within a day or so of posting a full update to the folder which the site points to Usually we upload a new folder of code rename folders and the new folder takes the place of the old folder The permission does not immediately uncheck it is hours later Is there any reasonable explanation why this might cause the script permission to disable automatically,iis7
One of my friends asks me the following scheduling problem on tree I find it is very clean and interesting Is there any reference for it Problem There is a tree T V E each edge has symmetric traveling cost of 1 For each vertex v_i there is a task which needs to be done before its deadline d_i The task is also denoted as v_i Each task has the uniform value 1 The processing time is 0 for each task i e visiting a task before its deadline equals finishing it Without loss of generality let v_0 denote the root and assuming there is no task located at v_0 There is a vehicle at v_0 at time 0 Besides we assume that d_i ge dep_i for every vertex dep_i stands for the depth of v_i This is self evident the vertex with deadline less than its depth should be taken as outlier The problem asks to find a scheduling which finishes as many tasks as possible Progress If the tree is restricted to a path then it is in mathsf P via dynamic programming If the tree is generalized to a graph then it is in mathsf NP complete I have a very simple greedy algorithm which is believed 3 factor apporoximation I have not proved it completely Rightnow I am more interested about the NP hard results Thanks for your advice,np

Is there any truly practical way to avoid using DTOs when passing data through Hibernate backed transactional service methods In other words are DTOs the only non hacky solution to avoiding lazy initialization problems I think the two popular alternatives to DTOs and the reasons I don t really like them are Open Session in View pattern This I don t like as I would like to keep the service methods truly transactional i e the Hibernate session is committed and closed when the method exits This is mainly because I would like to not have to worry about transactions if I for example need to publish the service as a web service later on Passing domain business objects through service methods instead of DTOs and eager fetching the needed attributes properties This is somewhat better However in a non trivial domain object hierarchy with complicated entity relations the eager fetching has to stop somewhere And when it does I can t see how this wouldn t very quickly turn into a complete hackaton replacing entities with referencing ids all over the place Am I missing something or are DTOs in fact the only solid approach from maintainability s point of view,dto

I have a webdev problemI have close to 10 000 serverside pages all of thse use the same stylesheet I have created a new serverside page which is like a dynamic menu system to help find specific pages from the existing 10 000 pages quickly and easily The problem is that if the serverside pages are accessed the old way using the old menu system they should retain their old stylesheet however if they are accessed via the new menu system they should use a new refreshed stylesheet Editing 10 000 ish pages does not seem like a good option What is the best way to go about tackling this problem,css
Quick question does Kohana version 3 automatically escape data that is passed into ORM factory and everywhere else that has to do with the database For example thread ORM factory thread this gt request gt param id Would the data passed in the second argument be auto escaped before it goes in the SQL query or do I have to manually do it Probably a stupid question and it s better to be safe than sorry but yeah I usually do manually escape the data but I want to know if Kohana does this for me Thanks,kohana

I m sure there is a simple way to fix this somewhere in Visual Studio s settings but I can t figure it out at all Here s my issue I m a novice programmer who s trying to work on my first large multimedia project and I ve realized that it would be in my best interest to set up a project file directory structure that is more organized to suit my needs Up until today I ve been just using Visual Studio s default directory and build options As of now my project is only about 10 headers and 10 source files so I thought it would be a good choice to re arrange everything sooner rather than later I thought that the easiest way to do this would be to start a clean solution and just import my old files Here s my planned folder structure Solution Project Source Files Header Files Multimedia Assets Release Builds DocumentationNow as I m new to Visual C I didn t realize that creating all these folders inside the solution explorer does not create actual folders inside windows So it seems to me at least So I went ahead and created a mirrored set of REAL folders inside my Solution Project directory I placed all my headers within my Header Files folder all my source code inside my Source Files folder etc The problem I have now is that Visual C is clearly expecting all my files to be within the same directory And my existing includes no longer work I ve tried changing them to be include Headers xxxxx h But that doesn t seem to work either I m not sure where I have to go to inform Visual Studio C Express where the root directory is Once I figure that out I would guess that it would be as simple as including the file path from that root directory Is there a way to set the root directory for my project to be my Project folder Or is there a better way to manage my file directory when using Visual Studio C Express,cpp

I have written a code which streams bytes from another server to my server and then I write those contents into my local file It works fine when I use the read method which doesn t buffer data But when I use buffering intention is that I believe streaming would be faster for big files I use read byte method and it gets only partial data while streaming I am posting the code Can any one pls point out the mistake or concepts what I am missing The following code works fine no streaming private void doViewDocument HttpServletRequest request HttpServletResponse response DocumentServletService servletService throws GEMException MalformedURLException ProtocolException IOException final String objectID request getParameter PARAM_OBJECT_ID LOGGER info For Viewing Document objectID received from Request objectID if GEMSharedUtil isValidObjectId objectID String ebesDocDownloadURL servletService getDocumentDownloadUrl objectID if GEMSharedUtil isValidString ebesDocDownloadURL response setStatus HttpServletResponse SC_NOT_ACCEPTABLE response setHeader ResponseStatus Not_OK throw new GEMException else HttpURLConnection con null BufferedInputStream bin null BufferedOutputStream bout null try con HttpURLConnection new URL ebesDocDownloadURL openConnection WASSecurity preauthenticateWithLTPACookie con con setRequestMethod REQUEST_METHOD_GET con setDoOutput true Triggers POST but since we have set request method so it will override it con setDoInput true con setUseCaches false con setRequestProperty Connection Keep Alive con setAllowUserInteraction false con setRequestProperty Content Type application octet stream response setBufferSize 1024 response setContentType con getContentType response setContentLength con getContentLength response setHeader ResponseStatus OK response setHeader Content Disposition con getHeaderField Content Disposition bin new BufferedInputStream InputStream con getInputStream 1024 bout new BufferedOutputStream response getOutputStream 1024 byte byteRead new byte 1024 File file new File C Documents and Settings weakStudent Desktop streamed testStream pdf FileOutputStream fos new FileOutputStream file if file length gt 0 file delete file createNewFile BufferedOutputStream fbout new BufferedOutputStream OutputStream fos int c while c bin read 1 bout write c fbout write c fos close bout flush fbout flush fbout close LOGGER info con getResponseCode con getResponseCode finally try if bout null bout close catch IOException e LOGGER log Level SEVERE e getMessage e throw new RuntimeException e finally try if bin null bin close catch IOException e LOGGER log Level SEVERE e getMessage e throw new RuntimeException e finally if con null con disconnect if ends Now if I have the following while loop it doesn t work correctly while bin read byteRead 1 bout write byteRead fbout write byteRead Q2 Also would like to know is it mandatory to use BufferedInputStream BufferedOutputStream for streaming For eg if I use following code snippet it works BufferedInputStream bin null try in request getInputStream bin new BufferedInputStream InputStream request getInputStream 1024 int respcode HttpURLConnection HTTP_OK con createConnection uploadURL REQUEST_METHOD_POST con setRequestProperty X File Name fileName conOut con getOutputStream bout new BufferedOutputStream conOut byte byteRead new byte 1024 while bin read byteRead 1 bout write byteRead bout flush respcode con getResponseCode But the following again streams partially no BufferedInputStream used here ServletInputStream in null try in request getInputStream int respcode HttpURLConnection HTTP_OK con createConnection uploadURL REQUEST_METHOD_POST con setRequestProperty X File Name fileName conOut con getOutputStream bout new BufferedOutputStream conOut byte byteRead new byte 1024 while in read byteRead 1 bout write byteRead bout flush respcode con getResponseCode,buffering

Preferably open source but I ll take free as in beer if that s not available or even a commercial product if it is clearly the best option I know there is a client built into Enterprise and Ultimate editions of Vista but I d rather not upgrade just for NFS Soren asks for alternatives instructions in the comments The nekodrive on google code looks like it could be promising however it falls short on good instructions and it look like it is only available for 64bit so I would accept an answer which would provide installation instructions only and or for a port for how to install on 32bit,network
Suppose a main form A and a modal dialog B I launch B from a thread using invoke as a modal dialog The dialog is correctly shown and it is launched using ShowDialog parent where parent is form A When I close B the main dialog A is not responding properly to some events such as mouse clicks This issue is only reproduced under the following circumstances The code is compiled using NET framework 1 1 profileThe code is executed in a Windows 7 x64 machineOnce I close the dialog the following symptoms occur Form A does not respond to some mouse clicks but respond to mouse moves buttons are highlighted on mouse move The main window close button is highlighted on mouse hover also can be clicked but the form is not closed New modal dialogs are not modal anymore Dialogs that have the property StartPosition CenterParent are not centered they are shown in the top left corner on the screen I was unable to reproduce the problem in other machine Also If I compile the code using NET 2 0 or higher the problem is not reproduced Any suggestion to solve this issue I need 1 1 for my application Any call I could perform to restore the event queue Thanks in advance,showdialog

i want that as a user is inserting data into a table he is also viewing it simultaneously for this if i use a single table then will it take more time amp processing load because the 2 processes INSERT and SELECT both would occur on the same table so i want that both the processes are executed separately on two different database objects like INSERT should be done on one database object and SELECT should be done from the other but the data which in inserted would be seen by the Select query what s the solution for this should i use a temporary table a view or two separate tables but if i use two separate tables then there would be replication of data so what shall i do please help My Winform Application would run on 3 PCs on LAN and SQL Server only on one PC In this case every minute all 3 users would insert data So I would display data immediately to the user at pc1 if data is updated by another user on pc2,server

I m just trying to understand the main benefits of using the Visitor pattern Here s a sample Java implementation Interfacesinterface MamalVisitor void visit Mammal mammal interface MammalVisitable public void accept MamalVisitor visitor interface Mammal extends MammalVisitable public int getLegsNumber Modelclass Human implements Mammal Override public void accept MamalVisitor visitor visitor visit this Override public int getLegsNumber return 2 PIRATE HAS A WOOD LEGclass Pirate extends Human Override public int getLegsNumber return 1 public int getWoodLegNumber return 1 class Dog implements Mammal Override public void accept MamalVisitor visitor visitor visit this Override public int getLegsNumber return 4 class LegCounterVisitor implements MamalVisitor private int legNumber 0 Override public void visit Mammal mammal legNumber mammal getLegsNumber public int getLegNumber return legNumber class WoodLegCounterVisitor implements MamalVisitor private int woodLegNumber 0 Override public void visit Mammal mammal perhaps bad but i m lazy if mammal instanceof Pirate woodLegNumber Pirate mammal getWoodLegNumber public int getWoodLegNumber return woodLegNumber public class Main public static void main String args Create a list with 9 mammal legs and 3 pirate woodlegs List lt Mammal gt mammalList Arrays asList new Pirate new Dog new Human new Pirate new Pirate The visitor method LegCounterVisitor legCounterVisitor new LegCounterVisitor WoodLegCounterVisitor woodLegCounterVisitor new WoodLegCounterVisitor for Mammal mammal mammalList mammal accept legCounterVisitor mammal accept woodLegCounterVisitor why not also using legCounterVisitor visit mammal woodLegCounterVisitor visit mammal System out println Number of legs legCounterVisitor getLegNumber System out println Number of wood legs woodLegCounterVisitor getWoodLegNumber The standart method int legNumber 0 int woodLegNumber 0 for Mammal mammal mammalList legNumber mammal getLegsNumber perhaps bad but i m lazy if mammal instanceof Pirate woodLegNumber Pirate mammal getWoodLegNumber System out println Number of legs legNumber System out println Number of wood legs woodLegNumber I just wonder what is the main advantage for this case to use such a pattern We can also iterate over the collection and get almost the same thing except we don t have to handle a new interface and add boilerplate code to the model With Apache Commons or a functional language the classic way seems to do some map reduce operation map to the leg numbers and reduce with addition and it s quite easy I also wonder why we use mammal accept legCounterVisitor mammal accept woodLegCounterVisitor and not legCounterVisitor visit mammal woodLegCounterVisitor visit mammal The 2nd option seems to remove the accept method on the model part In many samples i ve found it seems that they don t use a common interface for model objects I added it because like that i just have to add one visit Mammal method instead of implementing one for each Mammal Is it good to make all my objects implement Mammal i guess sometimes it s just not possible anyway Is it still a Visitor pattern like that So my questions are do you see any advantage in my exemple for using visitors if not can you provide some concrete usecases for visitors are visitors useful in functional programming languagesThe only exemple that i found relevant for this pattern is the case of a pretty printer where you keep in the visitor s state the offset to use during the visit of different nodes for displaying an XML tree for exemple,visitor

rails 3 0 1 fakefs 0 2 1 paperclip 2 3 4 rspec 2 0 1 I am testing my model with rspec Since this is a test I want to prevent any file creations under the public directory as paperclip normally does I am thinking this workaround is to use fakefs Although I implemented this http trevorturk com 2008 12 11 easy upload via url with paperclip to be able to save an image from a remote url if I don t put this line include FakeFS SpecHelpersto activate fakefs in my rspec it works fine and DOES create files under public system which I don t want for tests if I activate fakefs for some reasons I get an error such ascannot generate tempfile tmp stream20101027 704 adna7o 9 gif at the method def download_remote_image self image do_download_remote_image happening in this method self image_remote_url image_url end tmp permission is drwxrwxrwt so I think anyone can write on it and here are my questions Should I not use fakefs to test for paperclip related methods Should I not care about the paperclip file creations for such tests or there are any other ways to solve the problem,rspec2

I have table user_page_cells displayed with the following query SELECT tag_id nid FROM user_page_cells WHERE nid 1 It gives me the results I also have a table graph_tags SELECT FROM graph_tags where page_node 1 which gives me the results user_page_cells nid and graph_tags page_node both reference page nodes I need a query that will display my first query results SELECT tag_id nid FROM user_page_cells WHERE nid 1 with one extra column This column needs to have the default_graph_tag_id from the second table graph_tags if nid page_node or a NULL at all if it doesn t I have tried using LEFT RIGHT FULL OUTER JOIN but I cannot get the results I am looking for Here is an example of the query I thought would work SELECT user_page_cells tag_id graph_tags default_graph_tag_idFROM user_page_cellsLEFT OUTER JOIN graph_tags ON user_page_cells nid graph_tags page_nodeWHERE user_page_cells nid 1 I always get this no matter if LEFT RIGHT or FULL is used Can anyone point me in the right direction Thank you,join

I ve noticed this problem on Gingerbread Ice Cream Sandwich handles it fine but I worry that it is 2 3 and below Basically defining a css radial gradient fails when using pixel based color stops Percentages seem to work fine Here are the styles background ff6600 background webkit gradient radial 0 50 0 0 50 100 color stop 39px rgba 255 102 0 0 color stop 39px ff6600 color stop 100 ff6600 no repeat 0 0 background webkit radial gradient 0 50 circle rgba 255 102 0 0 39px ff6600 39px ff6600 no repeat 0 0 background moz radial gradient 0 50 circle rgba 255 102 0 0 39px ff6600 39px ff6600 no repeat 0 0 background o radial gradient 0 50 circle rgba 255 102 0 0 39px ff6600 39px ff6600 no repeat 0 0 background ms radial gradient 0 50 circle rgba 255 102 0 0 39px ff6600 39px ff6600 no repeat 0 0 background radial gradient 0 50 circle rgba 255 102 0 0 39px ff6600 39px ff6600 no repeat 0 0 moz background size 51 100 webkit background size 51 100 o background size 51 100 background size 51 100 These were generated by compass so I m sure they re solid syntax wise When I replace the 39px with a percentage value it works fine but that s not really what I m after the background size is irrelevant to this problem I believe Has anyone else run into this,gradients

Let A_n be the average number of comparisons to sort n keys by merging them in a top down fashion see any algorithm textbook It can he shown that A_0 A_1 0 quad A_n A_ lfloor n 2 rfloor A_ lceil n 2 rceil n frac lfloor n 2 rfloor lceil n 2 rceil 1 frac lceil n 2 rceil lfloor n 2 rfloor 1 See Knuth s AOCP for instance Flajolet and Golin in 1993 used complex analysis Mellin transforms and Fourier analysis to find a precise asymptotic approximation of A_n I am interested in finding lower and upper bounds on A_n of the form n lg n alpha n beta where lg n is the binary logarithm not using these powerful but complicated analytical approaches By distinguishing on the parity of n we simply get A_ 2p 2 A_ p 2p 2 frac 2 p 1 quad A_ 2p 1 A_ p A_ p 1 2p 1 frac 2 p 2 I tried difference equations by letting Delta_n A_ n 1 A_ n yielding Delta_ 2p Delta_ p 1 frac 2 p 2 frac 2 p 1 quad Delta_ 2p 1 Delta_p 1 Then I am stuck The same study for the maximum number of comparisons leads to simpler difference equations Delta_ 2p Delta_ 2p 1 Delta_ p 1 which implies Delta_n lfloor lg n rfloor 1 to wit the number of bits in the binary expansion of n From there a closed form for the maximum cost sum_ k 1 n 1 Delta_k follows relatively easily see Flajolet and Sedgewick for instance Any idea how to bound Delta_k and sum_ k 1 n 1 Delta_k in the present case,computational
I m trying to create a completely new database from an existing MySQL database bringing over both data and schema but so far the only way I ve been able to do this is to first import the MySQL database into MS Access and then into SQL Server 2005 Crazy right Surely there is a way that doesn t involve a tedious custom time consuming programming right perhaps using SSIS A few additions to my original description above Its a pretty good size database easily a few gigs I m working in an MS environment asp net C I m under a tight deadline so I m looking for an automated process that requires little to no effort in the conversion process SSIS would be the preferred way via BIDS VS 2005 Thanks for all the great input,visual

This question is about how to hide a column conditionally based on the values of a group that display on a single tab sheet It is a follow on to this question but it is really independent of I am using SSRS 2008 R2 My dataset is powered by a stored procedure and returns event related data EventID Event Owner Event Type LocationE001 Bob Meeting Conf Rm AE002 Jane eTraining E003 Bob Training Conf Rm BE004 Phil eTraining E005 Jane Meeting Conf Rm BE006 Phil Meeting Conf Rm AE007 Jane eTraining In my report I am using a table not a matrix I ve got an innermost Detail row with details about the event including the EventID and Location as columns There are several attributes by which I group the data The detail row and header row have a single row group assigned which groups by Event Owner and Event Type GrpbyOwnerandType There is a page break between each instance of the group which results in the results appearing on separate pages on the report server and on separate tabs when downloaded to Excel the ultimate goal Therefore the output in Excel is like this Tab 1 has E001 Bob Meeting Tab 2 has E002 amp E007 Jane eTraining Tab 3 has E003 Bob Training Tab 4 has E004 Phil eTraining Tab 5 has E005 Jane Meeting Tab 6 has E006 Phil Meeting On Tabs 2 and 4 I would like to hide the Location column because I feel silly displaying a completely blank column that is meaningless given then Event Type I try to do this by setting column visibility to IIF CountDistinct Fields EventLocation Value GrpbyOwnerandType 0 True False You can see that I m specifying the scope here to just the group GrpbyOwnerandType If I do not specify the scope then the test will clearly fail because there is at least one row in the dataset where the EventLocation is not NULL However when I specify the group in the scope of the IIF condition the report preview fails with this error The Hidden expression for the tablix X has a scope parameter that is not valid for an aggregate function The scope parameter must be set to a string constant that is equal to either the name of a containing group the name of a containing data region or the name of a dataset I used this same expression on the hidden attribute of the column and in that case the report does not error out but I m left with an ugly white column on Tab 2 and Tab 4 because there is no data So is there any way for me to hide the Location column on some but not all of the sheets Thanks in advance for your help,2008

My friend got a Sony Vaio laptop Soon I will install him Linux But I want to back up the Windows 7 s recovery partition that came pre installed But on laptop normally when we boot up they ask to press Fx where x is a number I don t know since its not my laptop to launch the recovery partition If I use Clonezilla to back up its recovery partition how may I restore the functionality to press Fx to start the recovery partition if I ever reformat the whole drive and rewrite the back up to the drive Also I heard that some computer vendor have a utility to create a set of Cd DVD that will restore everything like factory So it will restore the hidden partition Is it the case for Sony s laptop If yes which utility Does it will really recover the hidden recovery partition Do you recommend me Clonezilla for the backup,recovery

PrefaceI have three tables Customers Individuals amp Companies and a customer can be an individual or a company but not both I want to find out the general opinion on the correct way to link these three tables Details with exampleThe three tables are customers companies amp individuals and the MySQL code to generate the basic tables is SET OLD_UNIQUE_CHECKS UNIQUE_CHECKS UNIQUE_CHECKS 0 SET OLD_FOREIGN_KEY_CHECKS FOREIGN_KEY_CHECKS FOREIGN_KEY_CHECKS 0 SET OLD_SQL_MODE SQL_MODE SQL_MODE TRADITIONAL CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS mydb DEFAULT CHARACTER SET latin1 COLLATE latin1_swedish_ci USE mydb Table mydb customers CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS mydb customers CustomerID INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT Name VARCHAR 45 NULL PRIMARY KEY CustomerID ENGINE InnoDB Table mydb individuals CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS mydb individuals IndividualID INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT First Name VARCHAR 45 NULL Last Name VARCHAR 45 NULL DOB DATE NULL PRIMARY KEY IndividualID ENGINE InnoDB Table mydb companies CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS mydb companies CompanyID INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT Name VARCHAR 60 NULL StartedDate DATE NULL Address VARCHAR 500 NULL PRIMARY KEY CompanyID ENGINE InnoDB SET SQL_MODE OLD_SQL_MODE SET FOREIGN_KEY_CHECKS OLD_FOREIGN_KEY_CHECKS SET UNIQUE_CHECKS OLD_UNIQUE_CHECKS This is the basic tables with no links between them I have toyed with several methods of linking the tables but none of them felt right The first method was to basiclly pub a IndividualID amp CompanyID in the Customer Table and a boolean to say which one it was but this left it open to potentially have both filled in and no way to reinforce it with the DB directly it also it just didn t feel right that was like this SET OLD_UNIQUE_CHECKS UNIQUE_CHECKS UNIQUE_CHECKS 0 SET OLD_FOREIGN_KEY_CHECKS FOREIGN_KEY_CHECKS FOREIGN_KEY_CHECKS 0 SET OLD_SQL_MODE SQL_MODE SQL_MODE TRADITIONAL CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS mydb DEFAULT CHARACTER SET latin1 COLLATE latin1_swedish_ci USE mydb Table mydb companies CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS mydb companies CompanyID INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT Name VARCHAR 60 NULL StartedDate DATE NULL Address VARCHAR 500 NULL PRIMARY KEY CompanyID ENGINE InnoDB Table mydb individuals CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS mydb individuals IndividualID INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT First Name VARCHAR 45 NULL Last Name VARCHAR 45 NULL DOB DATE NULL PRIMARY KEY IndividualID ENGINE InnoDB Table mydb customers CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS mydb customers CustomerID INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT Name VARCHAR 45 NULL bIsCompany TINYINT 1 NOT NULL IndividualID INT

ENGINE InnoDB SET SQL_MODE OLD_SQL_MODE SET FOREIGN_KEY_CHECKS OLD_FOREIGN_KEY_CHECKS SET UNIQUE_CHECKS OLD_UNIQUE_CHECKS The other method was to add two tables between the customer and other two tables that linked them and that felt better but not perfect as again you COULD have a link in both That looked like this SET OLD_UNIQUE_CHECKS UNIQUE_CHECKS UNIQUE_CHECKS 0 SET OLD_FOREIGN_KEY_CHECKS FOREIGN_KEY_CHECKS FOREIGN_KEY_CHECKS 0 SET OLD_SQL_MODE SQL_MODE SQL_MODE TRADITIONAL CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS mydb DEFAULT CHARACTER SET latin1 COLLATE latin1_swedish_ci USE mydb Table mydb

OLD_FOREIGN_KEY_CHECKS SET UNIQUE_CHECKS OLD_UNIQUE_CHECKS As I mentioned that last option was the method that I preferred but it still didn t feel correct and could still lead to problems SO Questions Is there any other optionsWhat is the general opinion on the options stated and have I missed any advantages disadvantages to these options Thanks in advance,normalization

In my ASP NET MVC 2 web application I allow users to create custom input fields of different data types to extend our basic input form While tricky building the input form from a collection of custom fields is straight forward enough However I m now to the point where I want to handle the posting of this form and I m not certain what the best way to handle this would be Normally we d use strongly typed input models that get bound from the various statically typed inputs available on the form However I m at a loss for how to do this with a variable number of input fields that represent different data types A representative input form might look something like My date field date time inputcontrol My text field text inputfield My file field file uploadcontrol My number field numerical input control My text field 2 text input field etc Ideas I ve thought about are Sending everything as strings except for the file inputs which would need to be handled specially Using a model with an object property and attempting to bind to that if this is even possible Sending a json request to my controller with the data encoded properly and attempting to parse that Manually processing the form collection in my controller post action certainly an option but I d love to avoid this Has anyone tackled an issue like this before If so how did you solve it Update My base form is handled on another input area all together so a solution doesn t need to account for any sort of inheritence magic for this I m just interested in handling the custom fields on this interface not my base ones Update 2 Thank you to ARM and smartcaveman both of you provided good guidance for how this could be done I will update this question with my final solution once its been implemented,mvc
I am building a Joomla template and I have a problem with menu width that I have never discovered a cure for When I make a text based menu some items always go in two lines when zoomed or the resolution has changed for example Item 1 Item 2 Item 3 Item 4 Item 5 Becomes Item 1 Item 2 Item 3 Item 4 Item 5 So basically when I make a text based menu the width always will change However If I make it image based the problem is fixed but it can t be used for this project as it has too many menu items and some of them might be changed down the road I have seen a site that regenerates the font size every time you zoom in zoom out on the site to keep sites defined width however I don t remember it anymore Do any of you have ideas There must be some kind of script to force text based menus defined width no matter the browser font size settings zooming or display resolution Thanks in advance By the way here is the site http business delux lv I have actually noticed a lot of sites with this problem but some just don t have so much menu items for them to ever go in two lines so that kinda makes it not too noticeable,resolution
I ve created a indexed view in Sql Server 2008 In order to use incremental population on tables we need to create a timestamp column But should I create this timestamp column on the table wich is referenced by the view If so should the view return the timestamp column maybe sql needs to query the view to get the timestamp column and because of that i need to return it in my view,2008
Using FLVPlayback Captioning component I would like to move the subtitle text at certain parts in y position Is this possible in AS3 All of my own custom arguments are ignored when subtitles are parsed and wrapping the specific part with some sort of character won t do it either as I cannot change the text during runtime The reason is that in my videostreams there is boxes with text content that I don t want the subtitle on top of and rather above for reading purposes I was thinking of either doing an own manual subtitle function or custom flash cuepoints that I can access but want to know if anyone has done this before,captions

I ve written a portable framework in JavaScript and I d like to run some performance tests under various JavaScript interpreter shell environments In order to accomplish this I need to be able to pass command line arguments argv to the script context Rhino and Spidermonkey interpreters do this by default already exposing all arguments after the script file as an array bound to the the arguments identifier on the global object It was originally my intention to bring the same functionality to the v8 sample shell as well as the JavaScriptCore jsc shell but I soon realized that this would require much more effort and I really only need the last command line argument in order to run my tests So I have been able to get this working in v8 converting the last char element in argv to a v8 String and binding it to the identifier lastArg on the global object Unfortunately I m having much more trouble accomplishing the same thing with JavaScriptCore I haven t been able to find much documentation on the JavaScriptCore C API and the code in the JavaScriptCore jsc interpreter in Source JavaScriptCore jsc cpp is more difficult for me to understand than the code in the v8 sample shell Specifically I d appreciate any resources documentation tutorials sample code etc that could help illustrate the following tasks creating a new JavaScriptCore JSString instance from a char binding the JSString instance to an identifier on the GlobalObject global object instance I intend to simply patch function jscmain of jsc cpp int jscmain int argc char argv JSGlobalData globalData JSLock lock SilenceAssertionsOnly Options options parseArguments argc argv options globalData GlobalObject globalObject GlobalObject create globalData GlobalObject createStructure globalData jsNull options arguments TODO my patch would go here create a new javascript string and assign it to an identifier on globalObject instance bool success runWithScripts globalObject options scripts options dump if options interactive amp amp success runInteractive globalObject return success 0 3 I d greatly appreciate any guidance anyone can offer,javascriptcore

I just upgraded my HDD to an SSD drive I am running a completely fresh install and enjoy the short boot time I tweaked the startup to be as fast as I could by removing unneeded apps and such Nor am I running a solid desktop background which causes a 30 sec startup delay I have a 2 1ghz 64 bit laptop with 4 gigs of ram so it s not a liquid cooled speed monster but I checked some super high end PC boot vids on YouTube and noticed that they startup in almost the same time as my machine I also noticed that the glowing Windows 7 animation plays all the way no matter how fast the PC is I turned off the animation and the startup time is unchanged I turned on verbose startup info and noticed that it runs until the very end where it looks like it just sits there for no reason waiting for something to happen for a few seconds So now I think that the Windows 7 startup animation has a timer built into it that forces the computer to wait for no other reason than to play the full animation Super fast XP boot vids on YouTube seem to start much faster and not just because they have less to load Am I imagining things My question is How can I turn off not just the animation but the timer for the animation Here is a vid that tipped me off I have no relation to the poster warning soundtrack might be loud http www youtube com watch v T5LkX3xejJ4,speed

I ve recently been improving my skills with web programming to follow the saner and more maintainable MVC style of coding However one thing which I used to do with my roll your own framework was flexible dynamic routing based around mod_rewrite This appears to be a sore issue with things like cakephp zend etc and its causing me some headaches by trying to duplicate the functionality which I had In a roll your own context you could do something like the following lt custom htaccess rules before gt RewriteRule A Za z0 9 index php q 1 NC L which rewrites all matched urls to an arbitrary script that handles the url parses the combinations of abc 123 abc 456 controller value etc to any list of pages or actions functions etc that can be set up from a database table hardcoded bla bla The custom rules before can pass through matched requests for files that exist for resources on the server or setup admin routing etc However once the MVC url policy kicks in it is extremely hard to override this behaviour with something that hides the application logic from the outside world I never really understood why anyone would want to expose function names to a user and this is my real bugbear It seems unnecessary and an imposition too far from usability and security perspectives So the question is this how to approach a rewritten translatable and friendly url policy while maintaining a solid MVC foundation to the application Requisites No application logic exposedTranslatable URLs i18n Dynamic and ability to add remove edit urls or pages without touching application codeFun times DExample URLs en news story title pt noticias titulowhere the urls retrieve localised content based on language string passed,rewriting
It appears I have an upcoming code challenge from my boss to collect some statistics from Google and elsewhere compile and store it in whisper carbon and build a local Rails app to interface with Graphite s API to generate some charts and make graphs and stuff Could someone please explain to me sort of what the big picture Graphite concept is and why it s preferable to the first thing that comes to my mind when approaching a problem like this If it were me I d build a Rails app that interfaces with Google s API or wherever else statistical data will be coming from start storing that in the local Rails database via ActiveRecord and maybe run that chron job every day or whatever for the task at hand Then I d have a method in the app for taking that data pushing it to some Gem that simply generates realtime graphs charts etc such as say Gruff Graphics http nubyonrails com pages gruff and voila spit out graphical representations of the statistics Now looking at this Graphite stuff it looks like generating graphical data representation is one component of what it does and it must do it at least fairly well What I don t understand however is the need for this proprietary back end system written in Python no less if I m not mistaken and the other strange pieces that go with it I m sure there is some kick ass reason it was developed this way and why people use it this way but I am too new at this to really grasp it and in addition I wouldn t know the proper paradigm to begin developing an app like e g an entry point Thanks a ton for any assistance in undertstanding this,activerecord
I m currently doing research on a better way for emailing customers our news letter and not using an ESP such as vertical response since most users there use purchase list and ruin the shared IPs for everyone My question is do you really need to be sending hundreds of thousands of emails from your mail server IP address to be put on a accepted list for ISPs I ve read you need to be sending a constant amount of emails from your server I don t understand how this can even be true since no company in the world sends that many emails to a specific ISP Also do most email companies such as yahoo google and random ISP email providers such as time warner cox etc simply use DNSBLs to check each incoming mail to see if it s spam Thanks for all your help,spam
I Know I m able to pipe out in using simple Console WriteLine and Console ReadLine methods but that way I m passing a string between processes which must be parsed to recreate the object What I m wondering is if I would be able to pipe my own types so that I could retrieve them easily in destiny process What I expect is to do something like myProgram get memberAnd the output would something like MyNameSpace MyType and the list of its members currently it shows the typeName System String Is that possible in a console app or could I only achieve this using cmdlets,pipe

I m still learning Linux so bear with me I ran ldd on Apache s httpd and found many missing shared libraries I am new to this machine and am not sure whether some of these are misplaced or actually missing My best guess is someone installed a newer version of httpd and it requires newer versions of the shared libraries it cannot find I was able to find some of these libraries in other locations on the machine by doing locate libmm for instance However I don t know what version to link it with Case in point What should the following link to libssl so 2 gt not foundI have found no libssl so 2 on my machine but I have found lib libssl so 0 9 8e hmac lib libssl so 6 hmac lib libssl so 0 9 8e lib libssl so 6 lib64 libssl so 0 9 8e hmac lib64 libssl so 6 hmac lib64 libssl so 0 9 8e lib64 libssl so 6 usr lib libssl3 so usr lib64 libssl3 soIf I don t have the file to link to then how can I find the correct package online to install it For instance if I use yum search mm it is difficult to figure out what package to install and which one contains the correct shared library Is an easier way to simply reinstall Apache Here is the output of ldd ldd bin httpdlibaprutil 1 so 0 gt apache 2 2 24 rhas5 x86_64 lib libaprutil 1 so 0 0x00002ae571b0c000 libapr 1 so 0 gt apache 2 2 24 rhas5 x86_64 lib libapr 1 so 0 0x00002ae571d2f000 libuuid so 1 gt lib64 libuuid so 1 0x0000003fd7c00000 libpthread so 0 gt lib64 libpthread so 0 0x00002ae571f68000 libmm so 14 gt not foundlibxml2 so 2 gt usr lib64 libxml2 so 2 0x00002ae572183000 libm so 6 gt lib64 libm so 6 0x0000003fd8000000 libpcre so 0 gt lib64 libpcre so 0 0x0000003fd7000000 libcurl so 4 gt not foundlibidn so 11 gt usr lib64 libidn so 11 0x00002ae5724c2000 libldap 2 4 so 2 gt not foundlibrt so 1 gt lib64 librt so 1 0x0000003fd8800000 libcrypto so 1 0 0 gt not foundlibdl so 2 gt lib64 libdl so 2 0x00002ae5726f4000 libz so 1 gt usr lib64 libz so 1 0x0000003fd8400000 libexpat so 1 gt not foundlibssl so 1 0 0 gt not foundlibc so 6 gt lib64 libc so 6 0x0000003fd6c00000 lib64 ld linux x86 64 so 2 0x0000003fd6800000 libmm so 14 gt not foundlibcurl so 4 gt not foundlibssl so 1 0 0 gt not foundlibexpat so 1 gt not foundlibmm so 14 gt not foundlibcurl so 4 gt not foundlibexpat so 1 gt not foundlibssl so 1 0 0 gt not found,shared

I am currently running on Apple Mac OSX Lion 10 7 11A480b and I am trying to resize my partitions on the disk for one of our servers I already downsized a previous installation of Mac OSX Lion Server which in the meanwhile was used as swap disk for handling temporary overflow of incoming data which could not be transferred in the infrastructure while new data was being stored After downsizing the partition from 860GB or so to 212 33GB the partition that was initially meant to be resized could not be changed from the disk utility I have a partition called Macintosh HD previously quite big a partition called Recovery HD the operating system s disk and a Windows 7 partition containing Windows 7 for diagnostic reasons In the attachment it seems obvious that after downsizing Macintosh HD to 212 33GB Recovery HD cannot be upsized onto the space which initially was being used by Macintosh HD There s only the option to create a new partition Here s a screenshot Is there any actual way to resize Recovery HD onto the space of the previous Macintosh HD,partition

I have a migration where I m moving fields from one entity into another entity which is a child of an abstract entity My model has an entity Thing which is 1 M to an abstract entity AbstractWidget which is the parent for NewStuff Something like this Thing lt gt gt AbstractWidget lt NewStuff I am moving several attributes from Thing to NewStuff and I ve been following the instructions on a blog post I found that has instructions for making a similar change I ve created a new version with the structural changes and created a mapping model that include a mapping called ThingToNewThing which maps the fields but does not map the relationship per the instructions I didn t make the relationship change as the AbstractWidgets is already set up to properly work When I run my app I get a whole stream of stuff sent to the console that starts like this 2010 06 22 14 14 07 463 MyAppName 31418 207 Unresolved error Error Domain NSCocoaErrorDomain Code 134140 UserInfo 0x55249d0 Operation could not be completed Cocoa error 134140 followed by what seems to be a listing of the existing data properties I can t find anything about Cocoa error 134140 anywhere and I m not sure where to go from here Any guidance would be greatly appreciated,data

I currently have an old dedicated server with 1 amp 1 and planned to get a Dynamic Cloud even though it s not technically in the cloud server with 1 amp 1 still I have 26 domains which all seem to be tied to my current dedicated server and so in order to cancel the old server once I migrate everything over I also have to transfer all these domain names away from the old contract Apparently this is going to cost me the annual charge for each one potentially over Â 100 Not only that expense but I will also lose all email addresses mail when I make the move and so any people that have email addresses will need to download all their email during the move This seems crazy Is there anything I could be doing to avoid this headache other than not having touched 1 amp 1 in the first place,transferring

In my model I have an array of objects called events I would like my controller to be notified whenever a new object is added to events I thought that a good way to do this would be use the KVO pattern to get notified when the events changes from a new object being added AppDelegate events is a NSMutableArray property synthesize etc appDelagate addObserver self forKeyPath events options NSKeyValueObservingOptionNew context NULL But the observeValueForKeyPath method wasn t being called and I discovered that Arrays are not KVO compliant One option is to manually trigger the method by calling willChangeValueForKey for the keyPath ViewController self willChangeValueForKey events self events addObject event self didChangeValueForKey events But this feels heavy since I should probably also keep track of the before and after state of my events array so that it can be accessed from the observeValueForKeyPath method One approach could be to use a standard array instead of mutable and create set a new instance of events each time I want to add an new object or I could make a separate property that keeps track of how many items are in the mutable array I wish you could observe events count Another option would be to use NSNotificationCenter I ve also read some answers that suggest using blocks but I have no idea where to start on that Finally could I keep an instance of my controller in my delegate and just send a relevant message Delegate myController eventsDidChange Is it odd to keep a reference to a controller from a delegate I m struggling to understand how to choose which is the best approach to use so any advice on performance future code flexibility and best practices is greatly appreciated,value

I have been seeing information on how to move a repository if you have access to the server the repository is hosted on but what if you only have the login information for the repository Can you do a full checkout of a repository and all of its revisions and then move it to another repository The reason for this is because I have taken over a project but don t have access to the svn server although I have login credentials,svnadmin
I m just being picky but I was researching how does Entity Framework generates the DLL from an EDMX file and I saw this on msdn The Entity Data Model Designer Entity Designer stores model and mapping information in an edmx file at design time At build time the Entity Designer uses the information in an edmx file to create the csdl ssdl and msl files that are needed by the Entity Framework at runtime I actually found strange it saying that at build time the csdl ssdl and msl are created so I decided to test I know that the files are generated based on the TablePerTypeStrategy xaml flow so I removed it and tried to build my the application It succeeded When I picked generate database from model I did get an error saying the TablePerTypeStrategy xaml file was missing So I got confused clearly from this test the generation is being made when I try to generate the database not build the application What am I missing here,entity

I am using Ruby on Rails 3 and I would like to increase the expiration time for a cache key during the execution time I use memcached For example I have Rails cache write key_test value_test expires_in gt 10 seconds so that the key_test will expire in 10 seconds In order to make available that key value for longer what I can do Is it possible to increase only the expires_in without to set again the value_test The following code doesn t work but maybe I have to do something like this Rails cache write key_test expires_in gt 10 seconds,ruby

I am curious about developing a back end using the Play Framework in Scala I ve only tried the tutorial so far I was wondering is it possible to have the different responding threads exchange data For instance a counter that counts every time that an HTTP request has been handled It begins at 0 Then the first request comes in and it becomes 1 At the time of the second requests the handling thread can access that counter somewhere This should be achieved without any I O files DB In Java it would smell like a static variable but in Scala Thank you,playframework

I m forced to use IIS7 because Casini is only x86 and we are running with x64 ELMAH Something I ve noticed since I ve switched is that I cannot set breakpoints in ASP NET MVC views anymore I m not totally sure it s because of IIS7 is it Does it happen to you as well The Visual Studio 2008 project is configured to use the local IIS7 I normally run the project by pressing F5 which actually doesn t run anything It compiles the code and attaches itself to the corresponding IIS7 process The limitation of breakpoints is very hard into my environment now If I right click a piece of code in a view there s a Breakpoint sub menu like before with the Insert Breakpoint But when I try to insert a breakpoint I get a blue message at the bottom of Visual Studio saying This is not a valid location for a breakpoint and no breakpoint is set Setting breakpoints in the compiled code like the controller presents no problem Is there any way to solve put a breakpoint in the view,view

Imagine a stateless web application that processes many requests say a thousand per sec All data that we create inside the processing cycle will be immediately discarded at the end The app will use serialization deserialization a lot so we create and discard about 50 200kb on each request I think it could put a big pressure on garbage collector because GC will have to discard a large amount of short living objects Does it make sense to implement a pool of byte arrays to reuse them for serialization deserialization purposes Did anybody have such experience,garbage

I have an application which uses offline_access to get permanent access to different pages Users can install this application and add it to pages where they are admins With an external Backend they can administrate their app and let it post different things Competitions So they don t have to stay logged in to Facebook Now there is the problem On May 1st the offline_access permission will be removed and the customers have to get a new Token for their Pages every 60 days Since now I m using the offline_access feature for our customers to get non expiring Page Tokens Is there any workaround for that Often it s just a Facebook sub account of the customers to run the app So it s possible that they don t login for 60 days the access token will expire and the application won t work,access
First of all Hats of to StackOverflow for their great service and to you guys for taking your time to answer our questions I am using Doctrine ORM 1 2 4 with CodeIgniter 1 7 3 I created a Site with some required tables and pumped in with datas only to realize at a later point of time that a specific table needs to have one more column The way i created the tables was by writing the model as php classes which extend the Doctrine_Record Now i am wondering if i need to just add the column in the model that requires a new column in the setTableDefinition method and recreate that table or is there any other way that easily does this The former method i ve mentioned requires me to drop the current table along with the datas and recreate the table which i do not wish Since doctrine seems to be a very well architect ed database framework i believe it is lack of my knowledge but surely should exist a way to add new columns easily PS I am not trying to alter a column with relations to other tables but just add a new column which is not related to any other table Also i create the tables in the database using Doctrine createTablesFromModels When i alter a table with a new column and run this method it shows errors,operator

We currently run our web application on heroku and various parts of it use Hpricot to parse html Periodically different parts of the application will throw back an error that looks like the following NotImplementedError method inner_text called on terminated object 0x9f9d0d3dec68 The code segment that calls this method looks something like Hpricot some_html inner_textBut these errors pop up all over the code base it s not isolated to this one case this is just an example error We use airbrake to report errors so I immediately know when this happens and get a link to the page that caused it I am never able to reproduce the error by visiting the page and I have never seen the error in my development environment OS X 10 8 2 Hpricot will throw a different error if it gets passed a nil value ArgumentError and manually initializing the Hpricot object and then calling inner_text on it doesn t throw the error at least in the rails console and when visiting the same page again Production environment details Heroku bamboo stackruby 1 8 7hpricot 0 8 6I recognize that this is somewhat of a duplicate of What is a quot terminated object quot and why can 39 t I call methods on it but the last response to that is from July of 2011 Let me know if I can provide some more information,heroku

So I have a have a solution for this but I wanted to get some opinions and see if there was a better way to do this My problem is basically that I list of data that will get generated on load by RoR and then have JS controls to view subsets I would rather not have to support two versions of what is basically the same HMTL So my solution is this I have a ruby partial that looks something like this lt value1 jsmode value1 object value1value2 jsmode value2 object value2 gt lt div class object_template gt lt div gt lt value1 gt lt div gt lt div gt lt value2 gt lt div gt lt div gt So when I render the partial with ruby I pass in a jsmode of false and it renders like a normal partial Then I will render the partial again wrapped with a div with an ID of template but this time with a jsmode of true This will render the html with the strings I can then pass the template to prototype Template object like this new Template template evaluate value1 111 value2 222 So my question is is there a better way to do this I know that I can use the construct to pass variables to RoR if I wrap them with double quotes but I need the to render for the JS template Thoughts,prototype
I am building a system which is made up of 2 application ASP Net Website where jobs will be created for engineers to visit data held in central database Windows Forms Application running on Laptop where jobs will be synced from central database then a form is completed and data sent back to the central database What will be the best way to transfer the data the laptops will be remote and may be on a slow connection I will be using SQL Server 2008 Entity Framework Net 4 I have looked at the Microsoft Sync Framework but unsure if this will do whats required also thought about having a web service where the windows form client can pull and push data to I have had bad experiences with MSMQ so what to avoid this How would you approach this,message

I m new to the Ruby world and there is something unclear to me in defining associations between models The question is where is the association saved For example if i create a Customer model by executing generate model Customer name string age integerand then i create an Order modelgenerate model Order description text quantity integerand then i set the association in the following way class Customer lt ActiveRecord Base has_many ordersendclass Order lt ActiveRecord Base belongs_to customerendI think here is missing something for example the foreign key between the two entities How does it handle the associations created with the keywords has_many and belongs_to Thanks,associations

I ve managed to create a simple mandelbrot explorer using Open Gl and the CGFX SDK provided by NVidia It works well but is currently float based and therefore doesn t have much depth As the distance from the lowest complex number to the largest becomes smaller the precision is lost and the resultant image is pixelated Unfortunately CGFX doesn t seem to support double precision and even then double precision is limited for my intentions Because CGFX because of it s intended design does not have a bignum class I thought it would be best to create my own I managed to create a prototype in C which only uses unsigned integers but when I tried to move it to CGFX FX Composer 2 5 couldn t seem to compile it Because I am only using unsigned integers the multiplication and addition code contains a lot of bitshift operations which according to FX Composer 2 5 are not available in my profile I know that this question contains a lot of queries but unfortunately I m not really familiar with numerical analysis shader programming or open gl and at this point I feel overwhelmed And quite certain that I am trying to fix a leak with a sledge hammer So if anyone has an answer for anyone of these questions I d be grateful Does CGFX or any other shader language support bitshift operators on unsigned integers and floats Required to convert floats to big floats Does CGFX or any other shader language support double precision or greater floating point Is there a more refined mathemathical way of dealing with my issue rather than create a big float class If anyone needs a bit more clarification or code snippets feel free to ask,accuracy

I ve written an Application using Visual Studio 2008 on a Windows XP machine All the styling of the Form looks perfect there However when the Application is run on Windows 7 or Vista it uses the default style of those OS s instead and it messes up the way some things look I read that at build time embedding a Manifest in my code might tell Windows 7 that I want to use the form style Classic Style that I built the thing in no matter what OS I m on But it appears that this embedding is already being done by default so that s not the solution for me Thanks for any thoughts,themes
A web application we wrote intended for one customer is going to be product ized and sold to dozens of companies and we will be doing the hosting I could use some guidance about the pros and cons of rolling out a seperate instance for each customer versus going with a single or very small number of multi tenant instances At first as we ramp up I will have to roll out a seperate instance of the application for each new customer they will come online one at a time because it s the only immediate option I imagine this won t scale very well as far as maintenance goes rolling out changes will become very tedious and possibly error prone once there are more than 4 or 5 instances out there Unless we automate that somehow Also the single instance philosophy seems like it might lead to a bunch of forks if people need customizations And it would be nice to avoid that So what has your experience been with this Bonus question 1 What s the performance difference between 10 SQL Servers with 2m records each versus one huge one with 20m Let s say they are all in one table and we re mainly doing inserts and selects on single records Sometimes the selects are on an indexed varchar 12 or date field Bonus Question 2 I imagine that to avoid forking we would have to make the customizations configurable or build a plug in architecture However that might increase the cost of doing customizations and I don t want to be one of those shops that takes a week to resize a textbox and I don t want to over invest in infrastructure Any thoughts on that Scale DetailsEach customer will have a decent amount of data up to a few million records There will be a very small number of concurrent users only a few per customer plus a handful of internal reps on our end It s unclear whether each customer will require customizations but I would say some of them probably will and maybe some of those changes will be things that other customers will not want to see,tenant
There are many questions relating to simulating mouse keyboard input in WPF and Windows for that matter I have something a little different than the usual question I think and I d like your input Most posts I ve seen have a specific higher level action in mind I want to click this I want to move the mouse here etc To emulate these one can simply use routed events However I m hoping to operate a mouse from a remote app and would like to input mouse events at a low level current mouse position is x y and button state is such and such My target framework is WPF but if something like a generic virtual mouse driver is the way to go I m cool with that too I do not have security concerns the apps receiving the messages will be coded by me at a higher level so I don t need crazy hacks I m willing to use managed or unmanaged code and take the rabbit hole as deep as it needs to go to make this work but I don t want to reinvent the wheel I can host my apps in an HwndHost or some such too in case I need access to windows messages Thoughts,virtual

Which type of testing would you say should be the emphasis for testers QAs and why A quick set of definitions from wikipedia Black box testing takes an external perspective of the test object to derive test cases These tests can be functional or non functional though usually functional The test designer selects valid and invalid input and determines the correct output There is no knowledge of the test object s internal structure White box testing uses an internal perspective of the system to design test cases based on internal structure It requires programming skills to identify all paths through the software The tester chooses test case inputs to exercise paths through the code and determines the appropriate outputs In electrical hardware testing every node in a circuit may be probed and measured an example is in circuit testing ICT edit just to clarify a bit more I realize that both are important but usually they are separate between dev and QA Is internal knowledge important for the tester QA I ve heard arguments that testing with this knowledge in mind enables them to better test for problems but I ve also heard arguments that this knowledge can distract from functional needs and promote testing to to the code rather than to the intended solution,white

I m struggling to understand the correct model I have a uitableview full of rows of data The data is the result of a REST call which depends on the result of a previous REST call So in my appDelegate didFinishLaunchingWithOptions method I m making an NSURLConnection for the first REST call and then getting the results back in didReceiveData delegate method When that s finished I need to make a second rest call so I m doing that in the connectionDidFinishLoading method of the first REST call which in itself feels wrong but i don t know how else to only do it when the first REST call has finished without multi threading and synchronizing which seems overkill given how powerful this stuff is So then i get the xml back from the second REST call and build up my data objects ready for the UITableView cellAtIndexPath delegate method But the UI is already drawn before the data objects are populated so i can t figure out where to put in a spinner and how to synchronise on the connectionDidFinishLaunching message of the second REST call does that makes sense IT s really a pattern question more than a code question but i can t find a good example regards Richard,builder

This question is motivated by the Leighton Rao relaxation for SPARSEST CUT Suppose one wants to find a non trivial semimetric over an n point space that minimizes a certain linear functional More formally minimize sum_ ij 1 n c_ ij d_ ij where d is a semimetric over 1 2 ldots n and sum_ ij 1 n d_ ij 1 Of course it is a linear program that can be solved in polynomial time using ellipsoid method But what I would like to know is if there are any combinatorial algorithms for this optimization problem I suspect that the answer is no since the problem looks pretty general to be solved combinatorially but who knows,programming

Are there any frameworks libraries that provide servlets filters etc that handle reencoding on the fly of images interpret the accept headers and output the file reencoding into the new format if necessary by checking the actual format of the original image file provide a low and high quality version of an image re encode an image into new dimensions width and height parameters might query string parameters I could create versions of the file in all the formats at upload time but the seems overkill I would rather lazily create the rencoded file and stick it in a cache if it gets served again etc,servlet

We ve got a web server running RedHat Enterprise Linux 5 6 and it has all the usual local UNIX mailboxes As is typical the root mailbox gets all the cron output logwatch results etc I d like an easier way to keep an eye on this mailbox besides running mail via ssh What should I install enable to allow access to these system mailboxes via IMAP or POP3 with minimal fuss Either protocol would be fine for what I m doing as I could then add it as an account in Outlook A bit of searching led me to cyrus imapd and dovecot but it seems like they are meant for more serious mail hosting operations Either they use their own mailbox system exclusively or don t have a simple way of making the UNIX mailboxes available If I m wrong about that then I m fine with using either of them as long as I can get to the mailboxes of the existing accounts on the box,pop3

I m new to sockets and have a couple of questions on their usage in NET This is a consumer program so there won t be any scaling issues as the user runs the server and client 1 Is it better to keep a socket connection open until the server is closed or should I open a connection only when the user requests it and close it upon completion It s not a real time game so requests would be intermittent but are there any downsides to leaving the socket connection open 2 Do sockets require the user to have admin rights if they re running the server I looked around and it seemed that RAW sockets do but I plan on using Stream or Dgram instead depending on which works best for my program,udp

Are there any real world prototype based programming languages with a whole development cycle A whole development cycle like Ruby and Python web frameworks scripting interacting with the system tools for debugging profiling etc Thank youA brief note on PBPLs let s call these languages PBPL prototype based programming language There are some PBPLs out there Some are being widely used like JavaScript which Node js may bring it into the field or may not One other language is ActionScript which is also a PBPL but tightly bound to Flash VM is it correct to say so From less known ones I can speak of Lua which has a strong reputation in game development mostly spread by WOW but never took off as a full language Lua has a table concept which can provide you some sort of prototype based programming facility There is also JScript Windows scripting tool which is already pointless by the newcomer PowerShell I have used JScript to manipulate IIS but I never understood what is JScript Others can be named like io indeed very very neat you will fall in love with it absolutely impossible to use and REBOL What is this all about A proprietary scripting tool You must be kidding and newLISP Which is actually a full language but no one ever heard about it For sure there are much more to list here but either I do not remember or I did not understood them as a real world thing like Self,prototype

I have a work task which involves setting up Windows XP machines I m not a Windows user normally which is why I ask this question The tasks involved in setting up one of these machines involve setting network addresses users and specific Group Policies and currently I do this manually for each machine Naturally I want to script all these steps so I began to read up on the Registry and Windows Scripting I ve referred to various articles on the web and two books Microsoft Windows Scripting Self Paced Learning GuideWindows Registry Guide BookBetween all these sources of information it appears to me there s a hodge podge of Microsoft technologies which either duplicate means of accomplishing a specific task or uniquely achieve it but the documentation is confusing and unclear My simple way of understanding it is that the Registry is the container of all information data on a computer while WMI and ADSI provide the means to read or alter it Is this correct And if so how does ADSI relate to WMI andvice versa Can I even achieve what I want by simply manipulatingthe Registry directly with a vbs script say for altering the IPaddress of a network adapter Is there any need to use ADSI,registry

I m developing a php mysql application that handles multiple simultaneous users I m thinking of the best approach to take when it comes to locking warning against records that are currently being viewed edited The scenario to avoid is two users viewing the record one making a change then the other doing likewise with the potential that one change might overwrite the previous In the latest versions of WordPress they use some method to detect this but it does not seem wholly reliable often returning false positives at least in my experience I assume some form of ajax must be in place to ping the application and let it know the record is still being viewed edited otherwise a user might simply close their browser window and then how would the application know that Another solution I could see is to check the last updated time when a record is submitted for update to see if in the interim it has been updated elsewhere and then offer the user a choice to proceed or discard their own changes Perhaps I m barking up the wrong tree in terms of a solution what are peoples experiences of implementing this what must be a fairly common requirement,multi
PROBLEM I have several missing directories on an offsite Linux Apache server I ve tracked down about when they went missing from the httpd error logs and I have a list of SSL logins to the machine complete with network addresses There are several individuals who have access to my account on the machine so I am trying to confirm whether the files were removed accidentally or intentionally If I can determine that the session came from an external network address then I can be sure it was intentional Otherwise I will need additional information QUESTION Is there any way to determine what user account mine vs root network session or process removed the files I m not worried about restoring them as backups are recent RELATED QUESTION I ve tried looking at the bash history for my own account the only one other than root with permission and it only seems to extend back to the beginning of my SSL session Does this imply the bash history was tampered with or is this normal behavior,filesystems

Right now I am trying to design an Android app where a critical feature is the ability to click on an area and set a flag there To teach myself how the Google Maps API work I used the tutorial in the dev guide http developer android com resources tutorials views hello mapview htmlAt each step of the way I tried to understand exactly what was going on And for the most part I got it The one thing I don t understand are the references to Context Specifically in the HelloItemizedOverlay class in that tutorial there is the lineContext mContext and later on there are two constructors one of which takes a Context object as an argument and the other of which does not public HelloItemizedOverlay Drawable defaultMarker super boundCenterBottom defaultMarker public HelloItemizedOverlay Drawable defaultMarker Context context super boundCenterBottom defaultMarker mContext context The Context item appears to come into play later on in this class in the onTap method Overrideprotected boolean onTap int index OverlayItem item mOverlays get index AlertDialog Builder dialog new AlertDialog Builder mContext dialog setTitle item getTitle dialog setMessage item getSnippet dialog show return true However the tutorial doesn t explain how AlertDialog Builder works it just kind of throws it out there And it seems like understanding the purpose of this is critical to understanding why the Context object exists In the main and only activity for this tutorial the following lines seem to be the ones that interact with the HelloItemizedOverlay class List lt Overlay gt mapOverlays mapView getOverlays Drawable drawable this getResources getDrawable R drawable androidmarker HelloItemizedOverlay itemizedoverlay new HelloItemizedOverlay drawable GeoPoint point new GeoPoint 19240000 99120000 OverlayItem overlayitem new OverlayItem point Hello World Ciudad Mexico itemizedoverlay addOverlay overlayitem mapOverlays add itemizedoverlay The line marked with is the line that references the constructor for the HelloItemizedOverlay class However that line turned out to produce a NullPointerException error in the onTap method which makes sense because that method utilizes mContext which is never given a value After searching through StackOverflow I found that this was an error in the tutorial and that it could be fixed by changing the line to HelloItemizedOverlay itemizedoverlay new HelloItemizedOverlay drawable this Which indeed worked So my questions are What is Context I wasn t really able to find a clear and applicable answer on the internet Why and how is Context used in this tutorial and in the Google Maps set up in general What is up with the two constructors Thanks,google

For a TCP server with following structure main socket bind listen while 1 accept fork if child Process It creates a new socket for each client and communicates with all clients using the same port Thus all sockets bind to the same port I came across following comments when reading the kernel code 2 6 33 5 48 There are a few simple rules which allow for local port reuse by49 an application In essence 50 51 1 Sockets bound to different interfaces may share a local port 52 Failing that goto test 2 53 2 If all sockets have sk gt sk_reuse set and none of them are in54 TCP_LISTEN state the port may be shared 55 Failing that goto test 3 56 3 If all sockets are bound to a specific inet_sk sk gt rcv_saddr local57 address and none of them are the same the port may be58 shared 59 Failing this the port cannot be shared 60 So for the TCP server above is it the third rule which it matches,kernel
I have multiple Zend applications across a few virtual hosts E G intranet site com and api site com I am having some trouble accessing api site com sometimes I also have multiple backbone js models which make requests to the API to fill the models When I load an intranet page it will successfully do an XHR to the API at least 1 out of 3 times The other times I get this error Fatal error Cannot redeclare class Zend_Loader in C xampp htdocs Zend Loader php on line 31Now it happens sporadically I sometimes get it when it s just a normal GET request i e not an XMLHTTPRequest but I mostly get it when I do more than one API request on a single page load It s as though it s not treating the other API calls as a separate request I m not sure what could cause it seeing as it works sporadically I m on a Windows 7 environment with XAMPP if that matters It appears to have fewer issues on a linux environment but I can t develop the system on a linux environment,js

In my grad quantum E amp M classes I had to do intuition bending regularization of integrals that didn t seem mathematically justified but got full credit and were repeated in the solutions like the following int_ 0 infty sin x mathrm d x lim_ alpha to 0 int_ 0 infty e alpha x sin x mathrm d x lim_ alpha to 0 frac 1 alpha 2 1 1 which is unreasonable as int_ a b sin x mathrm d x cos a cos b or in our case lim_ b to infty 1 cos b mathrm undefined as the limit doesn t converge Is there any formal mathematics behind this line of thought claiming divergent things converge with regularization E g similar to the infinite sums 1 1 1 1 2 or 1 2 3 4 1 12,regularization
I have a fairly simple android app it gets protobuf data from a web server and has a java class generated by protoc Now I have no need for any other data than this data in my app So i thought I would simply use this data rather than wrapping it since this would just be a lot of extra work However sometimes i expand the tree with new data nested messages in proto file and then i need to be able to insert these in the current tree which is not allowed since the java class always returns unmodifiableList I am now thinking that i could get the list with reflection thus modifiable It does not seem like a great solution but it beats doing extra work for wrapping the class and all the stuff therein So my actual question is is this a big no no or would it be okay I read somewhere that even within google they argue if it s smart having the protobuf objects as data structure or only as pure send recieve messages,protocol
So if your Controller Action returns a Model with pre populated values how do you make KnockoutJS aware of them E g Html TextBoxFor m gt m Title new data_bind value title however on document ready where I bind knockout js ViewModel this value isn t yet populated document ready var viewModel title ko observable Title val too early for this ko applyBindings viewModel â How do you make KnockoutJS work with MVC s model binding One workaround I found was to set the JavaScript variable in my Razor View like so lt script gt var strTitle Model Title lt script gt and than use it in the Knockout model binding That works but I hate it What if your form has like hundreds of fields You don t want as many JavaScript variables in your page Am I missing the obvious here,knockout
I know that everyone uses an IDE nowadays but I just find it simpler to write my code in notepad compile it using a command prompt command and run it from there too At least that works for Java and Python I ve tried to get my head around how to do that with C and haven t been able to find anything good Is there any compiler like Java s JDK that I can stick into my path and use the C equivalent of javac and java to run and compile my code from CMD Note please don t post answers and comments about how IDEs are better I know they are I m just used to doing it the old way D,line

I have developed a single page app prototype that is using Backbone on the front end and going to consume from a thin RESTful API on the server for it s data Coming from heavy server side application development php and python I have really enjoyed the new different design approach with a thick client side MVC but am confused on how best to restrict the app to authenticated users who log in I prefer to have the app itself behind a login and would also like to implement other types of logins eventually openid fb connect etc in addition to the site s native login I am unclear how this is done and have been searching however unsuccessful in finding information that made it clear to me In the big picture what is the current best practice for registering users and requiring them to login to use your single page app Once a user is logged in how are the api requests authenticated Can I store a session but how do I detect for this session in the API calls or is there a token I have to pass in every single API call Any answers to this would be much appreciated,javascriptmvc

After implementing matrix multiplication with CUDA I tried to implement it with CUBLAS thanks to the advice of some people here in the forum I can multiply square matrices but yes once again I am having difficulties working with non square matrices The only type of non square matrix multiplication that works is when you vary Matrix A s Width A B C I don t get any errors but the resulting matrix returns wrong values Here is my code it is basically an adaptation of the simpleCUBLAS SDK example include lt stdlib h gt include lt stdio h gt include cublas h define HA 2 define WA 9 define WB 2 define HB WA define WC WB define HC HA define index i j ld j ld i void printMat float P int uWP int uHP printf n f P 1 int i j for i 0 i lt uHP i printf n for j 0 j lt uWP j printf f P index i j uHP printf f P i uWP j int main int argc char argv cublasStatus status int i j cublasInit float A float malloc HA WA sizeof float float B float malloc HB WB sizeof float float C float malloc HC WC sizeof float if A 0 fprintf stderr host memory allocation error A n return EXIT_FAILURE if B 0 fprintf stderr host memory allocation error A n return EXIT_FAILURE if C 0 fprintf stderr host memory allocation error A n return EXIT_FAILURE for i 0 i lt HA i for j 0 j lt WA j A index i j HA float index i j HA for i 0 i lt HB i for j 0 j lt WB j B index i j HB float index i j HB for i 0 i lt HA WA i A i float i for i 0 i lt HB WB i B i float i float AA float BB float CC ALLOCATE ON THE DEVICE status cublasAlloc HA WA sizeof float void amp AA if status CUBLAS_STATUS_SUCCESS fprintf stderr device memory allocation error A n return EXIT_FAILURE status cublasAlloc HB WB sizeof float void amp BB if status CUBLAS_STATUS_SUCCESS fprintf stderr device memory allocation error A n return EXIT_FAILURE status cublasAlloc HC WC sizeof float void amp CC if status CUBLAS_STATUS_SUCCESS fprintf stderr device memory allocation error A n return EXIT_FAILURE SET MATRIX status cublasSetMatrix HA WA sizeof float A HA AA HA if status CUBLAS_STATUS_SUCCESS fprintf stderr device memory allocation error A n return EXIT_FAILURE status cublasSetMatrix HB WB sizeof float B HB BB HB if status CUBLAS_STATUS_SUCCESS fprintf stderr device memory allocation error A n return EXIT_FAILURE KERNEL cublasSgemm n n HA WB WA 1 AA HA BB HB 0 CC HC status cublasGetError if status CUBLAS_STATUS_SUCCESS fprintf stderr kernel execution error n return EXIT_FAILURE cublasGetMatrix HC WC sizeof float CC HC C HC if status CUBLAS_STATUS_SUCCESS fprintf stderr device read error A n return EXIT_FAILURE PERFORMANCE OUTPUT printf nMatriz A n printMat A WA HA printf nMatriz B n printMat B WB HB printf nMatriz C n printMat C WC HC free A free B free C status cublasFree AA if status CUBLAS_STATUS_SUCCESS fprintf stderr memory free error A n return EXIT_FAILURE status cublasFree BB if status CUBLAS_STATUS_SUCCESS fprintf stderr memory free error B n return EXIT_FAILURE status cublasFree CC if status CUBLAS_STATUS_SUCCESS fprintf stderr memory free error C n return EXIT_FAILURE Shutdown status cublasShutdown if status CUBLAS_STATUS_SUCCESS fprintf stderr shutdown error A n return EXIT_FAILURE if argc gt 1 if strcmp argv 1 noprompt strcmp argv 1 qatest return EXIT_SUCCESS else printf nPress ENTER to exit n getchar return EXIT_SUCCESS Any thoughts Also does anyone has a matrix multiplication implementation in CUBLAS that is working so i could compare Thanks in advance,cublas
We have a website that has a common logon page A user chooses which site they want to use when they login and that site opens and the user has access based on their security In IE6 and IE7 a user can open 2 instances of IE and logon to 2 different locations and they work independently Using IE 8 or even chrome if a user logs in to one site and then opens another instance and goes to the logon page the site loads the same application the user is already in Is there a setting somewhere to open IE or Chrome sessions in a separated sandbox Even though i exampled chrome our endusers who this fix are for are IE8 sorry for the confusion,8
I saw an interesting link here about Linq To Sql More efficient database accessLooking at my own code I realized that I also haven t been disposing the DataClassesDataContext Is this a problem I don t know but I went searching through my code and added using DataClassesDataContext db new DataClassesDataContext throughout my code Now here is the interesting thing We log almost every page access and transaction in our code So I now have a block of code that looks like this protected WriteLog String activity using DataClassesDataContext db new DataClassesDataContext Do db write with Linq This is a very heavily used function with at least 50 calls second at any time So before I assume we suffered from potential leaks which is a problem But now it seems we that we won t be leaking DB resources but instead we will be spending a lot of time just opening and closing database connections This can t be right can it Is the above code now opening and closing a DB connection for every single log entry by our users adding even more overhead than just leaving the DataClassesDataContext to be garbage collected at a future time,performance
It seems like Windows XP doesn t recognize default icons of many applications in my old Dell machine e g Skype Windows Live Messenger Adobe Reader Microsoft Office 2003 Though I can open all those applications the most annoying part is that all files associated with them don t have icons too and I cannot get their types by glancing at their icons Is there a way to fix this without reinstalling Windows and all softwares FYI I have tried TweakUI and cleared icon cache but it didn t work,icons
Let me qualify my question with these points There is only one developer The developer is the server administrator The production server is Windows 2008 iis7 5 Sharepoint 2010 Enterprise and we have a copy of VS 2010 Enterprise and Active Directory We are too poor to buy another server but we can purchase a workstationI prefer to work from my workstation with a RDP connection to the server Some questions I thought of Is there a way to do the development from my workstation Will installing Sharepoint and Windows Server on my dev machine require a second set of licenses or are the ones I have for production sufficient and M understands Do I need to purchase another license for VS and SP2010 Is it preferable use a virtual machine or a real machine I found this post which is related Sharepoint 2010 Development Environment Set upWhat I am leaning toward is to purchase a 64 bit system with Windows 7 and lots of RAM and using that for development right now I am still using XP edit The idea of using a virtual drive is quite appealing and it appears that extra licenses must be purchased for that too but aren t licenses for VS and Sharepoint and Server only good for a few installations With that in mind it seems a regular hard drive SSD as is pointed out below would be better,licensing

I have a very simple Rails application that performs regular CRUD operations on an object Path this all fits nicely in the REST philosophy of Rails Now however I need to add a Duplicate feature i e create new path from existing path I have added it as an RESTfull action in my path_controller so far so good maybe not completely in line with the REST philosophy but I am not a purist Now I want to extend the functionality so that the users can choose to either create a completely new path from an existing one or copy the existing path to another already existing path duplicating its children This means I am going to need a few extra Views one that allows them to pick Option 1 Create New Object or Option 2 Duplicate to existing Object If they choose Option 2 I need another View that lets them then pick the path they want to copy to Each of these views needs a corresponding action and it is here that I am struggling as to where this all fits in REST This is a fairly simple example but as my UIs get more complex I always run into this issue How do I make my actions I need for my UI fit in REST controllers,on

While a specific use case I believe this may benefit others I am using TurboCSV to mass import a number of posts into WordPress which it is doing wonderfully so far Within that import I am specifying custom fields to be used in conjunction with Advanced Custom Fields to store output the data The post_meta table is being created correctly but the part that is not working as expected is generating ACF s hidden fields which work with field relationships When the import is first done those database tables are not created until you manually go into each post and re save them I was wondering if there is a way to fake the onSave event for WordPress for a number of posts ACF also passes along post information stored on the post edit screen to this save function which makes it a bit trickier but I d be interested if anyone has any thoughts Thanks,custom

From documentation it seems that UITableViewController would create its own Table View while being initialized So its tableView property would point to a Table View object right after initialization My questions are 1 Is it possible to create our own table view object and assign it to the tableView property of the UITableViewController object 2 If the above assignment can be made do we have to worry about releasing the old Table Viewobject that originally comes with the controller 3 If we can use our own custom made table view object is it advisable to do so,uitableviewcontroller
Greetings â I am experimenting with various software techniques to capture and analyze the messages being exchanged between web services web services that together would form a cloud hosted web application One of the initial steps is locating a â demoâ application to actually experiment against one that actually consists of and uses a multitude of web services Well finding such has turned out to be harder than I expected After searching numerous places the initial candidate applications I found did not pan out â each either uses callbacks such as into Python GAE libraries instead of web service invocations or the source code was not available I am seeking recommendations for a web services â demonstrationâ application That consists of and invokes a multitude of web services SOAP or REST â or JSON Has source code available the â mainâ application as well invoked web services so I can tweak the code to instrument the messages being passed around Runs on an available hosting service engine such as GAE I would prefer but do not require Python as the programming language since I have spent the last month learning it and using it on GAE Thanks from this newbie for your contribution Steve,applications

I m looking to purchase a rack enclosure for some servers As this is my first time shopping for this type of equipment I need to know what to look for I m asking not only about how to buy the rack but also what accessories will I need What can I do without What should I look for in terms of delivery and assembly What do I need to prepare for in terms of power Cooling inside the cabinet Anything else I might be overlooking I ll share some back story in case anyone finds it helpful but really generic answers for anyone who is shopping for rack equipment is helpful Where I m at we used to have mainly tower servers even a number of glorified desktops that lived in our server room We do have a couple two poster racks for switches but everything sits in a wooden bench made of 2x4 s and plywood that s been here much longer than I have Over the last three years I ve been able to virtualize the desktop servers and as items have come up for refresh I ve purchased rackmount servers with rails I put the servers on their sides in the old space and set the rails aside in the store room biding my time We are now at last to the point where in the next six months I ll be down to only a single tower server and it just happens to be 19 inches high so I m thinking 1U shelf Everything else except the the UPS equipment should mount in a rack In anticipation of that event I m looking to spec out a server rack enclosure to purchase and install this summer I want to be get preliminary shopping done over the next month or two so I can get it put into the budget for next fiscal year in time to actually execute the project late this summer For size we should fit comfortably inside a single 42U height wise even including mounting our existing switches so I m pretty sure one rack will handle it I just need to know what to look for in that rack,rackmount

I came to interesting theoretical problem Let s assume we have Program A and Program B connected via some IPC like tcp socket or named pipe Program A sends some data to Program B and depending on success of data delivery both A and B do some operations However B should do its operation only if it is sure that A has got the delivery confirmation So we came up to 3 connections A B data tranfer B A delivery confirmation A B confirmation of getting delivery confirmation It may look weird but the goal is to don t do any operation neither on A nor B until both sides know that data has been transfered And here is the problem because second connection is for confirmation of success of first And third is for confirmation of second but in fact there is no guarantee that connection 2 and 3 not fail and in that case we fall into infinite loop of confirmation Is there some CS theory which solve that problem,named
