I have a little game written in C It uses a database as back end It s a trading card game and I wanted to implement the function of the cards as a script What I mean is that I essentially have an interface ICard which a card class implements public class Card056 ICard and which contains function that are called by the game Now to make the thing maintainable moddable I would like to have the class for each card as source code in the database and essentially compile it on first use So when I have to add change a card I ll just add it to the database and tell my application to refresh without needing any assembly deployment especially since we would be talking about 1 assembly per card which means hundreds of assemblies Is that possible Register a class from a source file and then instantiate it etc ICard Cards current new MyGame CardLibrary Card056 Cards current OnEnterPlay ref currentGameState The language is C but extra bonus if it s possible to write the script in any NET language,csharp
I am working on a collection of classes used for video playback and recording I have one main class which acts like the public interface with methods like play stop pause record etc Then I have workhorse classes which do the video decoding and video encoding I just learned about the existence of nested classes in C and I m curious to know what programmers think about using them I am a little wary and not really sure what the benefits drawbacks are but they seem according to the book I m reading to be used in cases such as mine The book suggests that in a scenario like mine a good solution would be to nest the workhorse classes inside the interface class so there are no separate files for classes the client is not meant to use and to avoid any possible naming conflicts I don t know about these justifications Nested classes are a new concept to me Just want to see what programmers think about the issue,cpp
I would like the version property of my application to be incremented for each build but I m not sure on how to enable this functionality in Visual Studio 2005 2008 I have tried to specify the AssemblyVersion as 1 0 but it doesn t get me exactly what I want I m also using a settings file and in earlier attempts when the assembly version changed my settings got reset to the default since the application looked for the settings file in another directory I would like to be able to display a version number in the form of 1 1 38 so when a user finds a problem I can log the version they are using as well as tell them to upgrade if they have an old release A short explanation of how the versioning works would also be appreciated When does the build and revision number get incremented,csharp
What s the simplest way to connect and query a database for a set of records in C,csharp
I need to grab the base64 encoded representation of the ViewState Obviously this would not be available until fairly late in the request lifecycle which is OK For example if the output of the page includes lt input type hidden name __VIEWSTATE id __VIEWSTATE value wEPDwUJODU0Njc5MD gt I need a way on the server side to get the value wEPDwUJODU0Njc5MD To clarify I need this value when the page is being rendered not on PostBack e g I need to know the ViewState value that is being sent to the client not the ViewState I m getting back from them,csharp
I m looking for a way to delete a file which is locked by another process using C I suspect the method must be able to find which process is locking the file perhaps by tracking the handles although I m not sure how to do this in C then close that process before being able to complete the file delete using File Delete,csharp
Getting back into a bit more NET after a few years of not using it full time and wondering what the good unit testing packages are these days I m familiar with NUnit a few years ago and have played briefly around with IronRuby with the goal of getting something like rspec going but don t know much beyond that I realize I could google for this and call it a day but I believe I m likely to get a better and more informed response from asking a question here Suggestions,csharp

I am writing an application in Java for the desktop using the Eclipse SWT library for GUI rendering I think SWT helps Java get over the biggest hurdle for acceptance on the desktop namely providing a Java application with a consistent responsive interface that looks like that belonging to any other app on your desktop However I feel that packaging an application is still an issue OS X natively provides an easy mechanism for wrapping Java apps in native application bundles but producing an app for Windows Linux that doesn t require the user to run an ugly batch file or click on a jar is still a hassle Possibly that s not such an issue on Linux where the user is likely to be a little more tech savvy but on Windows I d like to have a regular exe for him her to run Has anyone had any experience with any of the exe generation tools for Java that are out there I ve tried JSmooth but had various issues with it Is there a better solution before I crack out Visual Studio and roll my own Edit I should perhaps mention that I am unable to spend a lot of money on a commercial solution,java

I am working on a project right now that involves receiving a message from another application formatting the contents of that message and sending it to a printer Technology of choice is C windows service The output could be called a report I suppose but a reporting engine is not necessary A simple templating engine like StringTemplate or even XSLT outputting HTML would be fine The problem I m having is finding a free way to print this kind of output from a service Since it seems that it will work I m working on a prototype using Microsoft s RDLC populating a local report and then rendering it as an image to a memory stream which I will then print Issues with that are Multi page printing will be a big headache Still have to use PrintDocument to print the memory stream which is unsupported in a Windows Service though it may work haven t gotten that far with the prototype yet If the data coming across changes I have to change the dataset and the class that the data is being deserialized into bad bad bad Has anyone had to do anything remotely like this Any advice I already posed a question about printing HTML without user input and after wasting about 3 days on that I have come to the conclusion that it cannot be done at least not with any freely available tool All help is appreciated EDIT We are on version 2 0 of the NET framework,csharp
So I ve been poking around with C a bit lately and all the Generic Collections have me a little confused Say I wanted to represent a data structure where the head of a tree was a key value pair and then there is one optional list of key value pairs below that but no more levels than these Would this be suitable public class TokenTree public TokenTree I must admit to not fully understanding this I got it from msdn As far as I can tell IDictionary is an interface and Dictionary is the default implementation of that interface right SubPairs new Dictionary lt string string gt public string Key public string Value public IDictionary lt string string gt SubPairs It s only really a simple shunt for passing around data,csharp
We have a remoting singleton server running in a separate windows service let s call her RemotingService The clients of the RemotingService are ASP NET instances many many Currently the clients remoting call RemotingService and blocks while the RemotingService call is serviced However the remoting service is getting complicated enough with more RPC calls and complex algorithms that the asp net worker threads are blocked for a significantly long time 4 5 seconds According to this msdn article doing this will not scale well because an asp net worker thread is blocked for each remoting RPC It advises switching to async handlers to free up asp net worker threads The purpose of an asynchronous handler is to free up an ASP NET thread pool thread to service additional requests while the handler is processing the original request This seems fine except the remoting call still takes up a thread from the thread pool Is this the same thread pool as the asp net worker threads How should I go about turning my remoting singleton server into an async system such that I free up my asp net worker threads I ve probably missed out some important information please let me know if there is anything else you need to know to answer the question,csharp

I have been looking into IKVMing Apache s FOP project to use with our NET app It s a commercial product and looking into licensing IKVM runs into some sticky areas because of its use of GNU Classpath From what I ve seen no one can say for sure if this stuff can be used in a commercial product Has anyone used IKVM or an IKVM d product in a commercial product Here s what I ve found so far IKVM license page which notes that one dll contains code from other projects their license GPLv2 Classpath Exception Saxon for NET is generated with IKVM but released under the Apache license Anyone have experience with this,java
Sorry for the basic question I m a NET developer and don t have much experience with LAMP setups I have a PHP site that will allow uploads to a specific folder I have been told that this folder needs to be owned by the webserver user for the upload process to work so I created the folder and then set permissions as such chown apache apache R uploads chmod 755 R uploads The only problem now is that the FTP user can not modify the uploaded files at all Is there a permission setting that will allow me to still upload files and then modify them later as a user other than the webserver user,php
This is a difficult and open ended question I know but I thought I d throw it to the floor and see if anyone had any interesting suggestions I have developed a code generator that takes our python interface to our C code generated via SWIG and generates code needed to expose this as WebServices When I developed this code I did it using TDD but I ve found my tests to be brittle as hell Because each test essentially wanted to verify that for a given bit of input code which happens to be a C header I d get a given bit of outputted code I wrote a small engine that reads test definitions from XML input files and generates test cases from these expectations The problem is I dread going in to modify the code at all That and the fact that the unit tests themselves are a complex and b brittle So I m trying to think of alternative approaches to this problem and it strikes me I m perhaps tackling it the wrong way Maybe I need to focus more on the outcome IE does the code I generate actually run and do what I want it to rather than does the code look the way I want it to Has anyone got any experiences of something similar to this they would care to share,cpp

What are some standard practices for managing a medium large JavaScript application My concerns are both speed for browser download and ease and maintainability of development Our JavaScript code is roughly namespaced as var Client var1 var2 accounts 100 s of functions and variables orders 100 s of functions and variables and subsections etc etc for a couple hundred kb At the moment we have one unpacked unstripped highly readable JavaScript file to handle all the business logic on the web application In addition there is jQuery and several jQuery extensions The problem we face is that it takes forever to find anything in the JavaScript code and the browser still has a dozen files to download Is it common to have a handful of source JavaScript files that gets compiled into one final compressed JavaScript file Any other handy hints or best practices,javascript

What makes a module service bit of application functionality a particularly good candidate for an OSGi module I m interested in using OSGi in my applications We re a Java shop and we use Spring pretty extensively so I m leaning toward using Spring Dynamic Modules for OSGi tm Service Platforms I m looking for a good way to incorporate a little bit of OSGi into an application as a trial Has anyone here used this or a similar OSGi technology Are there any pitfalls Nicolas Thanks I ve seen that one It s a good tutorial but I m looking more for ideas on how to do my first real OSGi bundle as opposed to a Hello World example david Thanks for the link Ideally with a greenfield app I d design the whole thing to be dynamic What I m looking for right now though is to introduce it in a small piece of an existing application Assuming I can pick any piece of the app what are some factors to consider that would make that piece better or worse as an OSGi guinea pig,java
Say I have an object that stores a byte array and I want to be able to efficiently generate a hashcode for it I ve used the cryptographic hash functions for this in the past because they are easy to implement but they are doing a lot more work than they should to be cryptographically oneway and I don t care about that I m just using the hashcode as a key into a hashtable Here s what I have today struct SomeData IEquatable lt SomeData gt private readonly byte data public SomeData byte data if null data data Length lt 0 throw new ArgumentException data this data new byte data Length Array Copy data this data data Length public override bool Equals object obj return obj is SomeData amp amp Equals SomeData obj public bool Equals SomeData other if other data Length data Length return false for int i 0 i lt data Length i if data i other data i return false return true public override int GetHashCode return BitConverter ToInt32 new MD5CryptoServiceProvider ComputeHash data 0 Any thoughts dp You are right that I missed a check in Equals I have updated it Using the existing hashcode from the byte array will result in reference equality or at least that same concept translated to hashcodes for example byte b1 new byte 1 byte b2 new byte 1 int h1 b1 GetHashCode int h2 b2 GetHashCode With that code despite the two byte arrays having the same values within them they are referring to different parts of memory and will result in probably different hash codes I need the hash codes for two byte arrays with the same contents to be equal,csharp
Every now and then in a high volume NET application you might see this exception when you try to execute a query System Data SqlClient SqlException A transport level error has occurred when sending the request to the server According to my research this is something that just happens and not much can be done to prevent it It does not happen as a result of a bad query and generally cannot be duplicated It just crops up maybe once every few days in a busy OLTP system when the TCP connection to the database goes bad for some reason I am forced to detect this error by parsing the exception message and then retrying the entire operation from scratch to include using a new connection None of that is pretty Anybody have any alternate solutions,csharp

We have a situation in our product where for a long time some data has been stored in the application s database as SQL string choice of MS SQL server or sybase SQL anywhere which was encrypted via the Windows API function CryptEncrypt direct and decryptable The problem is that CryptEncrypt can produce NULL s in the output meaning that when it s stored in the database the string manipulations will at some point truncate the ciphertext Ideally we d like to use an algo that will produce cyphertext that doesn t contain NULLs as that will cause the least amount of change to the existing databases changing a column from string to binary and code to deal with binary instead of strings and just decrypt existing data and re encrypt with the new algo at database upgrade time The algorithm doesn t need to be the most secure as the database is already in a reasonably secure environment not an open network teh interwebs but does need to bebetter than ROT13 which I can almost decrypt in my head now Cheers edit btw any particular reason for changing ciphertext to cyphertext ciphertext seems more widely used,cpp

I have a bunch of files TV episodes although that is fairly arbitrary that I want to check match a specific naming organisation scheme Currently I have three arrays of regex one for valid filenames one for files missing an episode name and one for valid paths Then I loop though each valid filename regex if it matches append it to a valid dict if not do the same with the missing ep name regexs if it matches this I append it to an invalid dict with an error code 2 missing epsiode name if it matches neither it gets added to invalid with the malformed name error code The current code can be found here I want to add a rule that checks for the presence of a folder jpg file in each directory but to add this would make the code substantially more messy in it s current state How could I write this system in a more expandable way The rules it needs to check would be File is in the format Show Name 01x23 Episode Name avi or Show Name 01xSpecial02 Special Name avi or Show Name 01xExtra01 Extra Name avi If filename is in the format Show Name 01x23 avi display it a missing episode name section of the output The path should be in the format Show Name season 2 the_file avi where season 2 should be the correct season number in the filename each Show Name season 1 folder should contain folder jpg any ideas While I m trying to check TV episodes this concept code should be able to apply to many things The only thought I had was a list of dicts in the format checker name valid files type file function check_valid runs check_valid on all files status 0 if it returns True this is the status the file gets,python

What is the best way to manage a list of windows keeping them in order to be able to promote the next window to the top level when the current top level window is closed This is for a web application so we re using jQuery Javascript We d talked through a few simplistic solutions such as using an array and just treating 0 index as the top most window I m wondering if there s any potentially more efficient or useful alternative to what we had brainstormed,javascript
I have a flex application that needs the ability to generate and execute JavaScript When I say this I mean I need to execute raw JavaScript that I create in my Flex application not just an existing JavaScript method I am currently doing this by exposing the following JavaScript method function doScript js eval js I can then do something like this in Flex note I am doing something more substantial then an alert box in the real Flex app ExternalInterface call doScript alert foo My question is does this impose any security risk I am assuming it s not since the Flex and JasvaScript all run client side Is there a better way to do this,javascript
I have a Java swing application with a panel that contains three JComboBoxes that do not draw properly The combox boxes just show up as the down arrow on the right side but without the label of the currently selected value The boxes will redraw correctly if the window is resized either bigger or smaller by even one pixel All of my googling has pointed to calling revalidate on the JPanel to fix this but that hasn t worked for me Calling updateUI on the JPanel has changed it from always displaying incorrectly to displaying incorrectly half of the time Has anyone else seen this and found a different way to force a redraw of the combo boxes,java
I seem to be missing something about LINQ To me it looks like it s taking some of the elements of SQL that I like the least and moving them into the C language and using them for other things I mean I could see the benefit of using SQL like statements on things other than databases But if I wanted to write SQL well why not just write SQL and keep it out of C What am I missing here,csharp
I ve created a map system for a game that runs on the principle of drawing the picture of the map from tiles There are many reasons for this which I won t go into here but if you really want to know then I m sure you can find out how to contact me I have made the latest version live so you can see exactly where the problem lies and the source The issue is the line between the top 2 tiles and the bottom 2 tiles I can t figure out why it s gone like this and any help would be appreciated In the source is a marker called stackoverflow if you search for stackoverflow when viewing source then it should take you to the table in question I have also uploaded an image of the issue,html
I have a listening port on my server that I m connecting to using a Java class and the Socket interface i e Socket mySocket new Socket host port I then grab an OutputStream decorate with a PrintWriter in autoflush mode and I m laughing except if the listening port closes Then I get tcp4 0 0 9999 LISTEN tcp 0 0 127 0 0 1 45737 127 0 0 1 9999 CLOSE_WAIT and I can t seem to detect the problem in the program I ve tried using the isConnected method on the socket but it doesn t seem to know that the connection is closed I want to be aware of the problem the next time I try and write to the Socket so that I can try and reconnect and report the issue Any advice please Thanks all,java
I am working on a function to establish the entropy of a distribution It uses a copula if any are familiar with that I need to sum up the values in the array based on which dimensions are cared about Example Consider the following example Dimension 0 across _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 0 _ _ 0 _ _ 0 _ _ 2 _ Dimension 1 _ 1 _ _ 0 _ _ 2 _ _ 0 _ down _ 0 _ _ 3 _ _ 0 _ _ 6 _ _ 0 _ _ 0 _ _ 0 _ _ 0 _ I care about dimension 0 only and don t care about the rest dim 1 Summing this array with the above specifications will collapse the stacks of dimension 1 down to a single 4 x 1 array _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 _ _ 3 _ _ 2 _ _ 8 _ This can then be summed or have any operation performed I need to do this with an array of n dimensions which could feasibly be 20 Also I need to be able to do this caring about certain dimensions and collapsing the rest I am having an especially hard time with this because I cant visualize 20 dimensions p If anyone could help me set up some c c code to collapse sum I would be very very grateful Update Just got home Here is some info to answer your questions Sorry for rolling back the edits I was hoping when I clicked roll back it would show me the changes so I could see what I messed up a bit like wikipedia This wasn t the case as I found out jeff What doesnt make sense I am using this great service for what I think is a legit reason I want to get better at my hobby which is all it is as I am in high school Many of my posts regard implementing a genetic algorithm This post sparsearray rank an array pointer manipulation I am using a sparse array representation as it is possible to exceed the number of molecules in the universe using a traditional dense array For now the implementation of the sparsearray itself doesnt matter a whole lot as I am working to make it work with a standard array before going to a sparse representation For those who havent seen my previous questions I am using a binary search tree as the structure to contain the sparse array points and a driver function to traverse the tree as necessary returning whatever the function is designed to do This is flexible so I can accomodate a lot of different methods of accessing the array The structure is a hypercube and the number of dimensions is specified at run time as well as the length of each dimension which are all the same as it is a hypercube Thanks everyone for your imput,cpp

My C program has a list of files that can be dragged from it and dropped into another program My requirements are that the file be copied to a different directory first So can I be notified of the drop operation so that I can only copy the file if operation succeeds I d rather wait till I know it needs to be copied before actually performing the copy Also is it possible to know what program the drop operation is occurring in Ideally I d like to alter the filepath based on who or what its being dropped The solution to this can be in any NET language or C C with COM,csharp

I m using TinyMCE in an ASP Net project and I need a spell check The only TinyMCE plugins I ve found use PHP on the server side and I guess I could just break down and install PHP on my server and do that but quite frankly what a pain I don t want to do that As it turns out Firefox s built in spell check will work fine for me but it doesn t seem to work on TinyMCE editor boxes I ve enabled the gecko_spellcheck option which is supposed to fix it but it doesn t Does anybody know of a nice rich text editor that doesn t break the browser s spell check,javascript
What is the best method to get objects out of a BlockingQueue in a concurrent program without hitting a race condition I m currently doing the following and I m not convinced it is the best method BlockingQueue lt Violation gt vQueue in the constructor I pass in a BlockingQueue object full of violations that need to be processed cut out for brevity Violation v while v vQueue poll 500 TimeUnit MILLISECONDS null do stuff with the violation I have yet to hit a race condition but I m none too sure if this is truly safe,java
Which is better to use in PHP a 2D array or a class I ve included an example of what I mean by this Using a class class someClass public name public height public weight function __construct name height weight this gt name name this gt height height this gt weight weight classArray 1 new someClass Bob 10 20 classArray 2 new someClass Fred 15 10 classArray 3 new someClass Ned 25 30 Using a 2D array normalArray 1 name Bob normalArray 1 height 10 normalArray 1 weight 20 normalArray 2 name Fred normalArray 2 height 15 normalArray 2 weight 10 normalArray 3 name Ned normalArray 3 height 25 normalArray 3 weight 30 Assuming that somebody doesn t come out and show that classes are too slow it looks like class wins I ve not idea which answer I should accept to I ve just upvoted all of them And I have now written two near identical pages one using the 2D array written before this question was posted and now one using a class and I must say that the class produces much nicer code I have no idea how much overhead is going to be generated but I doubt it will rival the improvement to the code itself Thank you for helping to make me a better programmer,php
I am hitting some performance bottlenecks with my C client inserting bulk data into a SQL Server 2005 database and I m looking for ways in which to speed up the process I am already using the SqlClient SqlBulkCopy which is based on TDS to speed up the data transfer across the wire which helped a lot but I m still looking for more I have a simple table that looks like this CREATE TABLE BulkData ContainerId int NOT NULL BinId smallint NOT NULL Sequence smallint NOT NULL ItemId int NOT NULL Left smallint NOT NULL Top smallint NOT NULL Right smallint NOT NULL Bottom smallint NOT NULL CONSTRAINT PKBulkData PRIMARY KEY CLUSTERED ContainerIdId ASC BinId ASC Sequence ASC I m inserting data in chunks that average about 300 rows where ContainerId and BinId are constant in each chunk and the Sequence value is 0 n and the values are pre sorted based on the primary key The Disk time performance counter spends a lot of time at 100 so it is clear that disk IO is the main issue but the speeds I m getting are several orders of magnitude below a raw file copy Does it help any if I Drop the Primary key while I am doing the inserting and recreate it later Do inserts into a temporary table with the same schema and periodically transfer them into the main table to keep the size of the table where insertions are happening small Anything else Based on the responses I have gotten let me clarify a little bit Portman I m using a clustered index because when the data is all imported I will need to access data sequentially in that order I don t particularly need the index to be there while importing the data Is there any advantage to having a nonclustered PK index while doing the inserts as opposed to dropping the constraint entirely for import Chopeen The data is being generated remotely on many other machines my SQL server can only handle about 10 currently but I would love to be able to add more It s not practical to run the entire process on the local machine because it would then have to process 50 times as much input data to generate the output Jason I am not doing any concurrent queries against the table during the import process I will try dropping the primary key and see if that helps,csharp

I m a web developer and I want to make the web sites I develop more accessible to those using screen readers What limitations do screen readers have that I should be most aware of and what can I do to avoid hitting these limitations This question was sparked by reading another question about non image based captchas In there a commenter said that honey pot form fields form fields hidden with CSS that only a bot would fill in are a bad idea because screen readers would still pick them up Are screen readers really so primitive that they would read text that isn t even displayed on the screen Ideally couldn t you make a screen reader that waited until the page was finished loading applied all css and even ran Javascript onload functions before it figured out what was actually displayed and then read that off to the user You could probably even identify parts of the page that are menus or table of contents and give some sort of easy way for those parts to be read exclusively or skipped over I would think that the programming community could come up with a better solution to this problem,html
I want to compare 2 arrays of objects in JavaScript code The objects have 8 total properties but each object will not have a value for each and the arrays are never going to be any larger than 8 items each so maybe the brute force method of traversing each and then looking at the values of the 8 properties is the easiest way to do what I want to do but before implementing I wanted to see if anyone had a more elegant solution Any thoughts,javascript

In Java 5 and above you have the foreach loop which works magically on anything that implements Iterable for Object o list doStuff o However Enumerable still does not implement Iterable meaning that to iterate over an Enumeration you must do the following for e hasMoreElements doStuff e nextElement Does anyone know if there is a reason why Enumeration still does not implement Iterable Edit As a clarification I m not talking about the language concept of an enum I m talking a Java specific class in the Java API called Enumeration,java

We currently maintain a suit of MFC applications that are fairly well designed however the user interface is beginning to look tired and a lot of the code is in need quite a bit of refactoring to tidy up some duplication and or performance problems We make use of quite a few custom controls that handle all their own drawing all written using MFC Recently I ve been doing more research into Qt and the benefits it provides cross platform and supports what you might call a more professional looking framework for UI development My question is what would be the best approach to perhaps moving to the Qt framework Does Qt play nice with MFC Would it be better to start porting some of our custom controls to Qt and gradually integrate more and more into our existing MFC apps is this possible Any advice or previous experience is appreciated,cpp

For whatever reason our company has a coding guideline that states Each class shall have it s own header and implementation file So if we wrote a class called MyString we would need an associated MyStringh h and MyString cxx Does anyone else do this Has anyone seen any compiling performance repercussions as a result Does 5000 classes in 10000 files compile just as quickly as 5000 classes in 2500 files If not is the difference noticeable We code C and use GCC 3 4 4 as our everyday compiler,cpp

I am in the middle of reading the excellent Clean Code One discussion is regarding passing nulls into a method public class MetricsCalculator public double xProjection Point p1 Point p2 return p2 x p1 x 1 5 calculator xProjection null new Point 12 13 It represents different ways of handling this public double xProjection Point p1 Point p2 if p1 null p2 null throw new IllegalArgumentException Invalid argument for xProjection return p2 x p1 x 1 5 public double xProjection Point p1 Point p2 assert p1 null p1 should not be null assert p2 null p2 should not be null return p2 x p1 x 1 5 I prefer the assertions approach but I don t like the fact that assertions are turned off by default The book finally states In most programming languages there is no good way to deal with a null that is passed by a caller accidentally Because this is the case the rational approach is to forbid passing null by default It doesn t really go into how you would enforce this restriction Do any of you have strong opinions either way,java
How is your javaScript code organized Does it follow patterns like MVC or something else I ve been working on a side project for some time now and the further I get the more my webpage has turned into a full featured application Right now I m sticking with jQuery however the logic on the page is growing to a point where some organization or dare I say it architecture is needed My first approach is MVC ish The model is a JSON tree that gets extended with helpers The view is the DOM plus classes that tweak it The controller is the object where I connect events handling and kick off view or model manipulation I m very interested however in how other people have built more substantial javaScript apps I m not interested in GWT or other server oriented approaches just in the approach of javaScript lt generic web service y thingy here gt Note earlier I said javaScript is not really OO not really functional This I think distracted everyone Let s put it this way because javaScript is unique in many ways and I m coming from a strongly typed background I don t want to force paradigms I know but were developed in very different languages,javascript

I have a byte array the contents of which represent a TIFF file as in if I write out these bytes directly to a file using the BinaryWriter object it forms a perfectly valid TIFF file and I m trying to turn it into a System Drawing Image object so that I can use it for later manipulation feeding into a multipage TIFF object The problem I m having is that the commonly accepted code for this task public Image byteArrayToImage byte byteArrayIn MemoryStream ms new MemoryStream byteArrayIn Image returnImage Image FromStream ms true return returnImage doesn t work for me The second line of the above method where it calls the Image FromStream method dies at runtime saying Parameter Not Valid I believe that the method is choking on the fact that this is a TIFF file but I cannot figure out how to make the FromStream method accept this fact How do I turn a byte array of a TIFF image into an Image object Also like I said the end goal of this is to have a byte array representing a multipage TIFF file which contains the TIFF files for which I have byte array objects of right now If there s a much better way to go about doing this I m all for it,csharp

In a web application I have a page that contains a DIV that has an auto width depending on the width of the browser window I need an auto height for the object The DIV starts about 300px from the top screen and it s height should make it stretch to the bottom of the browser screen I have a max height for the container DIV so there would have to be minimum height for the div I believe I can just restrict that in CSS and use Javascript to handle the resizing of the DIV My javascript isn t nearly as good as it should be Is there an easy script I could write that would do this for me Edit The DIV houses a control that does it s own overflow handling implements its own scroll bar,javascript

In one of my applications I am querying active directory to get a list of all users below a given user using the Direct Reports thing So basically given the name of the person it is looked up in AD then the Direct Reports are read But then for every direct report the tool needs to check the direct reports of the direct reports Or more abstract The Tool will use a person as the root of the tree and then walk down the complete tree to get the names of all the leaves can be several hundred Now my concern is obviously performance as this needs to be done quite a few times My idea is to manually cache that essentially just put all the names in a long string and store that somewhere and update it once a day But I just wonder if there is a more elegant way to first get the information and then cache it possibly using something in the System DirectoryServices Namespace,csharp
In Ruby on Rails I m attempting to update the innerHTML of a div tag using the form_remote_tag helper This update happens whenever an associated select tag receives an onchange event The problem is lt select onchange this form submit gt doesn t work Nor does document forms 0 submit The only way to get the onsubmit code generated in the form_remote_tag to execute is to create a hidden submit button and invoke the click method on the button from the select tag Here s a working ERb partial example lt form_remote_tag url gt product_path update gt content method gt get do gt lt content_tag div id gt content do gt lt select_tag update options_for_select foo 1 bar 2 onchange gt this form commit click gt lt submit_tag submit_button style gt display none gt lt end gt lt end gt What I want to do is something like this but it doesn t work lt form_remote_tag url gt product_path update gt content method gt get do gt lt content_tag div id gt content do gt the following line does not work lt select_tag update options_for_select foo 1 bar 2 onchange gt this form onsubmit gt lt end gt lt end gt So is there any way to remove the invisible submit button for this use case There seems to be some confusion So let me explain The basic problem is that submit doesn t call the onsubmit code rendered into the form The actual HTML form that Rails renders from this ERb looks like this lt form action products 1 method post onsubmit new Ajax Updater content products 1 asynchronous true evalScripts true method get parameters Form serialize this return false gt lt div style margin 0 padding 0 gt lt input name authenticity_token type hidden value 4eacf78eb87e9262a0b631a8a6e417e9a5957cab gt lt div gt lt div id content gt lt select id update name update onchange this form commit click gt lt option value 1 gt foo lt option gt lt option value 2 gt bar lt option gt lt select gt lt input name commit style display none type submit value submit_button gt lt div gt lt form gt I want to axe the invisible submit button but using a straight form submit appears to not work So I need some way to call the form s onsubmit event code Update Orion Edwards solution would work if there wasn t a return false generated by Rails I m not sure which is worse though sending a phantom click to an invisible submit button or calling eval on the getAttribute onsubmit call after removing the return call with a javascript string replacement,javascript

I used the jQuery Form plugin for asynchronous form submission For forms that contain files it copies the form to a hidden iframe submits it and copies back the iframe s contents The problem is that I can t figure out how to find what HTTP status code was returned by the server For example if the server returns 404 the data from the iframe will be copied as normal and treated as a regular response I ve tried poking around in the iframe objects looking for some sort of status_code attribute but haven t been able to find anything like that The ajax function can t be used because it does not support uploading files The only way to asynchronously upload files that I know of is using the hidden iframe method,jquery
I am starting to use Python specifically because of Django and I would like to remove the burden for exhaustive testing by performing some static analysis What tools parameters etc exist to detect issues at compile time that would otherwise show up during runtime type errors are probably the most obvious case of this but undefined variables are another big one that could be avoided with an in depth analysis of the AST Obviously testing is important and I don t imply that tests can be obviated entirely however there are many runtime errors in python that are not possible in other languages that perform stricter run time checking I m hoping that there are tools to bring at least some of these capabilities to python as well,python
I need an associative container that makes me index a certain object through a string but that also keeps the order of insertion so I can look for a specific object by its name or just iterate on it and retrieve objects in the same order I inserted them I think this hybrid of linked list and hash map should do the job but before I tried to use std tr1 unordered_map thinking that it was working in that way I described but it wasn t So could someone explain me the meaning and behavior of unordered_map wesc I m sure std map is implemented by STL while I m sure std hash_map is NOT in the STL I think older version of Visual Studio put it in a namespace called stdext cristopher so if I get it right the difference is in the implementation and thus performances not in the way it behaves externally,cpp
I have a method which takes params object such as void Foo params object items Console WriteLine items 0 When I pass two object arrays to this method it works fine Foo new object object 1 object 2 new object object 3 object 4 Output System Object But when I pass a single object it does not take my object as the first param instead it takes its all elements like I wanted to pass them one by one Foo new object object 1 object 2 Output 1 expected System Object How do I pass a single object as a first argument to a params array,csharp

I have developed some classes with similar behavior they all implement the same interface I implemented a factory that creates the appropriate object and returns the interface I am writing a unit test for the factory All you get back is an interface to the object What is the best way to test that the factory has worked correctly I would like to know the answer in Java but if there is a solution that crosses languages I would like to know it Number 2 in the answer would be done like the other answer If so I will mark the other answer accepted as well and reword my question to adress both a factory where an interface is returned and you have no clue what type of concrete class implemented the interface and the case where you do know what concrete class was used,java

Ok so my visual studio is broken I say this NOT prematurely as it was my first response to see where I had messed up in my code When I add controls to the page I can t reference all of them in the code behind Some of them I can it seems that the first few I put on a page work then it just stops I first thought it may be the type of control as initially I was trying to reference a repeater inside an update panel I know I am correctly referencing the code behind in my aspx page But just in case it was a screw up on my part I started to recreate the page from scratch and this time got a few more controls down before VS stopped recognizing my controls After creating my page twice and getting stuck I thought maybe it was still the type of controls I created a new page and just threw some labels on it No dice build fails when referencing the control from the code behind In a possibly unrelated note when I switch to the dreaded design mode of the aspx pages VS 2008 errors out and restarts I have already put a trouble ticket in to Microsoft I uninstalled all add ins I reinstalled visual studio Anyone that wants to see my code just ask but I am using the straight WYSIWYG visual studio new aspx page nothing fancy I doubt anyone has run into this but have you Has anyone had success trouble shooting these things with Microsoft Any way to expedite this ticket without paying I have been talking to a rep from Microsoft for days with no luck yet and I am dead in the water Thank you Jon Limjap I edited the title to both make it clear and descriptive and make sure that nobody sees it as offensive Foo barred doesn t exactly constitute a proper question title although your question is clearly a valid one,csharp

When it comes to web design I am horrible at producing anything remotely good looking Thankfully there are a lot of free sources for design templates However a problem with these designs is that they just cover a single page and not many use cases If you take a look at CSS Zen Gardens they have 1 single HTML file and can radically style it differently by just changing the CSS file Now I am wondering if there is a standard HTML layout tags and ids that covers alot of use cases and can be generically themed with different CSS files like Zen Garden What I am imagining is a set of rules off how you write your html and what boxes lists menus and styles you are supposed to use A set of standard test pages covering the various uses can be created and a new CSS file while have to support all the different pages in a nice view Is there any projects that covers anything similar to what I am describing,html

So I did search google and SO prior to asking this question Basically I have a DLL that has a form compiled into it The form will be used to display information to the screen Eventually it will be asynchronous and expose a lot of customization in the dll For now I just want it to display properly The problem that I am having is that I use the dll by loading it in a Powershell session So when I try to display the form and get it to come to the top and have focus It has no problem with displaying over all the other apps but I can t for the life of me get it to display over the Powershell window Here is the code that I am currently using to try and get it to display I am sure that the majority of it won t be required once I figure it out this just represents all the things that I found via google CLass Blah DllImport user32 dll EntryPoint SystemParametersInfo public static extern bool SystemParametersInfo uint uiAction uint uiParam uint pvParam uint fWinIni DllImport user32 dll EntryPoint SetForegroundWindow public static extern bool SetForegroundWindow IntPtr hWnd DllImport User32 dll EntryPoint ShowWindowAsync private static extern bool ShowWindowAsync IntPtr hWnd int cmdShow private const int WS_SHOWNORMAL 1 public void ShowMessage string msg MessageForm msgFrm new MessageForm msgFrm lblMessage Text FOO msgFrm ShowDialog msgFrm BringToFront msgFrm TopMost true msgFrm Activate SystemParametersInfo uint 0x2001 0 0 0x0002 0x0001 ShowWindowAsync msgFrm Handle WS_SHOWNORMAL SetForegroundWindow msgFrm Handle SystemParametersInfo uint 0x2001 200000 200000 0x0002 0x0001 As I say I m sure that most of that is either not needed or even flat out wrong I just wanted to show the things that I had tried Also as I mentioned I plan to have this be asynchronously displayed at some point which I suspect will wind up requiring a separate thread Would splitting the form out into it s own thread make it easier to cause it to get focus over the Powershell session Joel thanks for the info Here is what I tried based on your suggestion msgFrm ShowDialog msgFrm BringToFront msgFrm Focus Application DoEvents The form still comes up under the Powershell session I ll proceed with working out the threading I ve spawned threads before but never where the parent thread needed to talk to the child thread so we ll see how it goes Thnks for all the ideas so far folks Ok threading it took care of the problem Quarrelsome I did try both of those Neither nor both together worked I am curious as to what is evil about using threading I am not using Application Run and I have yet to have a problem I am using a mediator class that both the parent thread and the child thread have access to In that object I am using a ReaderWriterLock to lock one property that represents the message that I want displayed on the form that the child thread creates The parent locks the property then writes what should be displayed The child thread locks the property and reads what it should change the label on the form to The child has to do this on a polling interval I default it to 500ms which I m not real happy about but I could not find an event driven way to let the child thread know that the proerty had changed so I m stuck with polling,csharp

I am looking for a way to create an int long representation of an arbitrary alpha numeric String Hash codes won t do it because I can t afford hash collisions i e the representation must be unique and repeatable The numeric representation will be used to perform efficient hopefully compares The creation of the numeric key will take some time but it only has to happen once whereas I need to perform vast numbers of comparisons with it which will hopefully be much faster than comparing the raw Strings Any other idea s on faster String comparison will be most appreciated too,java

I would like to implement something similar to a c delegate method in PHP A quick word to explain what I m trying to do overall I am trying to implement some asynchronous functionality Basically some resource intensive calls that get queued cached and dispatched when the underlying system gets around to it When the asynchronous call finally receives a response I would like a callback event to be raised I am having some problems coming up with a mechanism to do callbacks in PHP I have come up with a method that works for now but I am unhappy with it Basically it involves passing a reference to the object and the name of the method on it that will serve as the callback taking the response as an argument and then use eval to call the method when need be This is sub optimal for a variety of reasons is there a better way of doing this that anyone knows of,php
Say I have a Textbox nested within a TabControl When the form loads I would like to focus on that Textbox by default the focus is set to the TabControl Simply calling textbox1 focus in the Load event of the form does not appear to work I have been able to focus it by doing the following private void frmMainLoad object sender EventArgs e foreach TabPage tab in this tabControl1 TabPages this tabControl1 SelectedTab tab My question is Is there a more elegant way to do this,csharp
What can be a practical solution to center vertically and horizontally content in HTML that works in Firefox IE6 and IE7 Some details I am looking for solution for the entire page You need to specify only width of the element to be centered Height of the element is not known in design time When minimizing window scrolling should appear only when all white space is gone In other words width of screen should be represented as leftSpace width screenWidth widthOfCenteredElement 2 centeredElement width widthOfCenteredElement rightSpace width screenWidth widthOfCenteredElement 2 And the same for the height topSpace height screenHeight heightOfCenteredElement 2 centeredElement height heightOfCenteredElement bottomSpace height screenWidth heightOfCenteredElement 2 By practical I mean that use of tables is OK I intend to use this layout mostly for special pages like login So CSS purity is not so important here while following standards is desirable for future compatibility,html
I have just started working with the AnimationExtender I am using it to show a new div with a list gathered from a database when a button is pressed The problem is the button needs to do a postback to get this list as I don t want to make the call to the database unless it s needed The postback however stops the animation mid flow and resets it The button is within an update panel Ideally I would want the animation to start once the postback is complete and the list has been gathered I have looked into using the ScriptManager to detect when the postback is complete and have made some progress I have added two javascript methods to the page function linkPostback var prm Sys WebForms PageRequestManager getInstance prm add_endRequest playAnimation function playAnimation var onclkBehavior find ctl00_btnOpenList get_OnClickBehavior get_animation onclkBehavior play And I      ve changed the btnOpenList OnClientClick       linkPostback       This almost solves the problem I      m still get some animation stutter The animation starts to play before the postback and then plays properly after postback Using the onclkBehavior pause has no effect I can get around this by setting the AnimationExtender Enabled false and setting it to true in the buttons postback event This however works only once as now the AnimationExtender is enabled again I have also tried disabling the AnimationExtender via javascript but this has no effect Is there a way of playing the animations only via javascript calls I need to decouple the automatic link to the buttons click event so I can control when the animation is fired Hope that makes sense Thanks DG,csharp

We have an Apache ANT script to build our application then check in the resulting JAR file into version control VSS in this case However now we have a change that requires us to build 2 JAR files for this project then check both into VSS The current target that checks the original JAR file into VSS discovers the name of the JAR file through some property Is there an easy way to generalize this target so that I can reuse it to check in a JAR file with any name In a normal language this would obviously call for a function parameter but to my knowledge there really isn t an equivalent concept in ANT,java

The Sun Documentation for DataInput skipBytes states that it makes an attempt to skip over n bytes of data from the input stream discarding the skipped bytes However it may skip over some smaller number of bytes possibly zero This may result from any of a number of conditions reaching end of file before n bytes have been skipped is only one possibility Other than reaching end of file why might skipBytes not skip the right number of bytes The DataInputStream I am using will either be wrapping a FileInputStream or a PipedInputStream If I definitely want to skip n bytes and throw an EOFException if this causes me to go to the end of the file should I use readFully and ignore the resulting byte array Or is there a better way,java

Dictionaries unlike lists are not ordered and do not have the sort attribute Therefore you can not rely on getting the items in the same order when first added What is the easiest way to loop through a dictionary containing strings as the key value and retrieving them in ascending order by key For example you had this d b this is b a this is a c this is c I want to print the associated values in the following sequence sorted by key this is a this is b this is c,python
I have some code that modifies a value that several controls in other update panels are bound to When this event handler fires I d like it to force the other update panels to refresh as well so they can rebind Is this possible Edit To clarify I have an update panel in one user control the other update panels are in other user controls so they can t see each other unless I were to expose some custom properties and use findControl etc etc Edit Again Here is what I came up with public void Update recursiveUpdate this private void recursiveUpdate Control control foreach Control c in control Controls if c is UpdatePanel UpdatePanel c Update if c HasControls recursiveUpdate c I had 3 main user controls that were full of update panels these controls were visible to the main page so I added an Update method there that called Update on those three In my triggering control I just cast this Page into the currentpage and called Update Edit AARRGGGG While the update panels refresh it does not call Page_Load within the subcontrols in them What do I do now,csharp

Please now that I ve re written the question and before it suffers from further fast gun answers or premature closure by eager editors let me point out that this is not a duplicate of this question I know how to remove duplicates from an array This question is about removing sequences from an array not duplicates in the strict sense Consider this sequence of elements in an array 0 a 1 a 2 b 3 c 4 c 5 a 6 c 7 d 8 c 9 d In this example I want to obtain the following 0 a 1 b 2 c 3 a 4 c 5 d Notice that duplicate elements are retained but that sequences of the same element have been reduced to a single instance of that element Further notice that when two lines repeat they should be reduced to one set of two lines 0 c 1 d 2 c 3 d reduces to 0 c 1 d I m coding in C but algorithms in any language appreciated,csharp

I m writing a utility for myself partly as an exercise in learning C Reflection and partly because I actually want the resulting tool for my own use What I m after is basically pointing the application at an assembly and choosing a given class from which to select properties that should be included in an exported HTML form as fields That form will be then used in my ASP NET MVC app as the beginning of a View As I m using Subsonic objects for the applications where I want to use this should be reasonable and I figured that by wanting to include things like differing output HTML depending on data type Reflection was the way to get this done What I m looking for however seems to be elusive I m trying to take the DLL EXE that s chosen through the OpenFileDialog as the starting point and load it String FilePath Path GetDirectoryName FileName System Reflection Assembly o System Reflection Assembly LoadFile FileName That works fine but because Subsonic generated objects actually are full of object types that are defined in Subsonic dll etc those dependent objects aren t loaded Enter AssemblyName ReferencedAssemblies o GetReferencedAssemblies That too contains exactly what I would expect it to However what I m trying to figure out is how to load those assemblies so that my digging into my objects will work properly I understand that if those assemblies were in the GAC or in the directory of the running executable I could just load them by their name but that isn t likely to be the case for this use case and it s my primary use case So what it boils down to is how do I load a given assembly and all of its arbitrary assemblies starting with a filename and resulting in a completely Reflection browsable tree of types properties methods etc I know that tools like Reflector do this I just can t find the syntax for getting at it,csharp

I understand the main function of the lock key word from MSDN lock Statement C Reference The lock keyword marks a statement block as a critical section by obtaining the mutual exclusion lock for a given object executing a statement and then releasing the lock When should the lock be used For instance it makes sense with multi threaded applications because it protects the data But is it necessary when the application does not spin off any other threads Is there performance issues with using lock I have just inherited an application that is using lock everywhere and it is single threaded and I want to know should I leave them in are they even necessary Please note this is more of a general knowledge question the application speed is fine I want to know if that is a good design pattern to follow in the future or should this be avoided unless absolutely needed,csharp
So I m working on an exceedingly large codebase and recently upgraded to gcc 4 3 which now triggers this warning warning deprecated conversion from string constant to       char       Obviously the correct way to fix this is to find every declaration like char s constant string or function call like void foo char s foo constant string and make them const char pointers However that would mean touching 564 files minimum which is not a task I wish to perform at this point in time The problem right now is that I m running with werror so I need some way to stifle these warnings How can I do that,cpp

Backgrounder The PIMPL Idiom Pointer to IMPLementation is a technique for implementation hiding in which a public class wraps a structure or class that cannot be seen outside the library the public class is part of This hides internal implementation details and data from the user of the library When implementing this idiom why would you place the public methods on the pimpl class and not the public class since the public classes method implementations would be compiled into the library and the user only has the header file To illustrate this code puts the Purr implementation on the impl class and wraps it as well Why not implement Purr directly on the public class header file class Cat private class CatImpl Not defined here CatImpl cat_ Handle public Cat Constructor Cat Destructor Other operations Purr CPP file include cat h class Cat CatImpl Purr The actual implementation can be anything Cat Cat cat_ new CatImpl Cat Cat delete cat_ Cat Purr cat_ gt Purr CatImpl Purr printf purrrrrr,cpp

While it would be very convenient to use inline functions at some situations Are there any drawbacks with inline functions Conclusion Apparently There is nothing wrong with using inline functions But it is worth noting the following points Overuse of inlining can actually make programs slower Depending on a function s size inlining it can cause the code size to increase or decrease Inlining a very small accessor function will usually decrease code size while inlining a very large function can dramatically increase code size On modern processors smaller code usually runs faster due to better use of the instruction cache Google Guidelines The speed benefits of inline functions tend to diminish as the function grows in size At some point the overhead of the function call becomes small compared to the execution of the function body and the benefit is lost Source There are few situations where an inline function may not work For a function returning values if a return statement exists For a function not returning any values if a loop switch or goto statement exists If a function is recursive Source The __inline keyword causes a function to be inlined only if you specify the optimize option If optimize is specified whether or not __inline is honored depends on the setting of the inline optimizer option By default the inline option is in effect whenever the optimizer is run If you specify optimize you must also specify the noinline option if you want the __inline keyword to be ignored Source,cpp
I need advice on how to have my C console application display text to the user through the standard output while still being able access it later on The actual feature I would like to implement is to dump the entire output buffer to a text file at the end of program execution The workaround I use while I don t find a cleaner approach is to subclass TextWriter overriding the writing methods so they would both write to a file and call the original stdout writer Something like this public class DirtyWorkaround private class DirtyWriter TextWriter private TextWriter stdoutWriter private StreamWriter fileWriter public DirtyWriter string path TextWriter stdoutWriter this stdoutWriter stdoutWriter this fileWriter new StreamWriter path override public void Write string s stdoutWriter Write s fileWriter Write s fileWriter Flush Same as above for WriteLine and WriteLine string plus whatever methods I need to override to inherit from TextWriter Encoding Get I guess public static void Main string args using DirtyWriter dw new DirtyWriter path Console Out Console SetOut dw Teh codez See that it writes to and flushes the file all the time I d love to do it only at the end of the execution but I couldn t find any way to access to the output buffer Also excuse inaccuracies with the above code had to write it ad hoc sorry,csharp
My motto for Java is just because Java has static blocks it doesn t mean that you should be using them Jokes aside there are a lot of tricks in Java that make testing a nightmare Two of the most I hate are Anonymous Classes and Static Blocks We have a lot of legacy code that make use of Static Blocks and these are one of the annoying points in our push in writing unit tests Our goal is to be able to write unit tests for classes that depend on this static initialization with minimal code changes So far my suggestion to my colleagues is to move the body of the static block into a private static method and call it staticInit This method can then be called from within the static block For unit testing another class that depends on this class could easily mock staticInit with JMockit to not do anything Let s see this in example public class ClassWithStaticInit static System out println static initializer Will be changed to public class ClassWithStaticInit static staticInit private static void staticInit System out println static initialized So that we can do the following in a JUnit public class DependentClassTest public static class MockClassWithStaticInit public static void staticInit BeforeClass public static void setUpBeforeClass Mockit redefineMethods ClassWithStaticInit class MockClassWithStaticInit class However this solution also comes with its own problems You can t run DependentClassTest and ClassWithStaticInitTest on the same JVM since you actually want the static block to run for ClassWithStaticInitTest What would be your way of accomplishing this task Or any better non JMockit based solutions that you think would work cleaner,java

While working in a Java app I recently needed to assemble a comma delimited list of values to pass to another web service without knowing how many elements there would be in advance The best I could come up with off the top of my head was something like this public String appendWithDelimiter String original String addition String delimiter if original equals return addition else return original delimiter addition String parameterString if condition parameterString appendWithDelimiter parameterString elementName if anotherCondition parameterString appendWithDelimiter parameterString anotherElementName I realize this isn t particularly efficient since there are strings being created all over the place but I was going for clarity more than optimization In Ruby I can do something like this instead which feels much more elegant parameterArray parameterArray lt lt elementName if condition parameterArray lt lt anotherElementName if anotherCondition parameterString parameterArray join But since Java lacks a join command I couldn t figure out anything equivalent So what s the best way to do this in Java,java

I haven t programmed games for about 10 years My last experience was DJGPP Allegro but I thought I d check out XNA over the weekend to see how it was shaping up I am fairly impressed however as I continue to piece together a game engine I have a probably basic question How much should you rely on C s Delegates and Events to drive the game As an application programmer I use delegates and events heavily but I don t know if there is a significant overhead to doing so In my game engine I have designed a chase cam of sorts that can be attached to an object and then recalculates its position relative to the object When the object moves there are two ways to update the chase cam Have an UpdateCameras method in the main game loop Use an event handler and have the chase cam subscribe to object OnMoved I m using the latter because it allows me to chain events together and nicely automate large parts of the engine Suddenly what would be huge and complex get dropped down to a handful of 3 5 line event handlers Its a beauty However if event handlers firing every nanosecond turn out to be a major slowdown I ll remove it and go with the loop approach Ideas,csharp

Is it really viable to use GCJ to publish server side applications Webapps My boss is convinced that compiling our my webapp into a binary executable is a brilliant idea Then again he likes nice small simple things with blinky lights that he can understand He instinctively sees no issues with this while I only see an endless series of problems and degradations Once I start talking to him about the complexity of our platform and more in depth specifics of byte code JVMs libraries differences between operating systems processor architectures etc well his eyes glaze over he smiles and he has made it clear he thinks I m being childishly resistive Why does he want a single magic executable He sees a couple of benefits If it is a binary executable then it is hard to reverse engineer and circumvent any licensing Management lives in constant fear that this is happening even though we sell into larger corporates who generally do not do cheat with server software There is that vision of downloading this magic executable running it and everything works No more sending me out to do customer installations which is not that frequent So I ve done my obligatory 20 minutes of googling and now I am here A bit of background on my application What it is made from Java 6 Sun s JVM AspectJ 1 6 Tomcat 6 Hibernate 3 Spring 2 another two dozen supporting jar files What it does A streaming media CMS Performance sensitive Deployed on Linux Solaris Windows and developed on a Mac As you can probably gather I m highly skeptical of this compiling Java to native code thing It sound like where Mono VB on Linux was back in 2000 But am I being overly pessimistic Is it viable Should I actually spend the time days if not weeks to try this out There is one other similar thread Java Compiler Options to produce exe files but it is a bit too simple the links dated and not really geared towards a server side question Your informed opinions will be highly cherished my dear SOpedians TIA,java

I m trying to implement some drag and drop functionality for a material system being developed at my work Part of this system includes a Material Library which acts as a repository divided into groups of saved materials on the user s hard drive As part of some UI polish I was hoping to implement a highlight type feature When dragging and dropping windows that you can legally drop a material onto will very subtly change color to improve feedback to the user that this is a valid action In the included screenshot I am changing the bar with Basic Materials Just a CWnd with a CStatic from having a medium gray background when unhighlighed to a blue background when hovered over It all works well the OnDragEnter and OnDragExit messages seem robust and set a flag indicating the highlight status Then in OnCtrlColor I do this if m_bHighlighted pDC gt FillSolidRect 0 0 m_SizeX kGroupHeaderHeight kBackgroundColour else pDC gt FillSolidRect 0 0 m_SizeX kGroupHeaderHeight kHighlightedBackgroundColour However as you can see in the screenshot the painting glitches below the dragged object leaving the original gray in place It looks really ugly and basically spoils the whole effect Is there any way I can get around this MFC isn t fun at the best of times and this is causing me to tear my hair out All help gratefully appreciated,cpp

I develop an extension module for Guile written in C This extension module embeds a Python interpreter Since this extension module invokes the Python interpreter I need to verify that it properly manages the memory occupied by Python objects I found that the Python interpreter is well behaved in its own memory handling so that by running valgrind I can find memory leaks due to bugs in my own Python interpreter embedding code if there are no other interfering factors However when I run Guile under valgrind valgrind reports memory leaks Such memory leaks obscure any memory leaks due to my own code The question is what can I do to separate memory leaks due to bugs in my code from memory leaks reported by valgrind as due to Guile Another tool instead of valgrind Special valgrind options Give up and rely upon manual code walkthrough,python

Tomcat version 5 here stores session information in memory When clustering this information is periodically broadcast to other servers in the cluster to keep things in sync You can use a database store to make sessions persistant but this information is only written periodically as well and is only really used for failure recovery rather than actually replacing the in memory sessions If you don t want to use sticky sessions our configuration doesn t allow it unfortunately this raises the problem of the sessions getting out of sync In other languages web frameworks tend to allow you to use a database as the primary session store Whilst this introduces a potential scaling issue it does make session management very straightforward I m wondering if there s a way to get tomcat to use a database for sessions in this way technically this would also remove the need for any clustering configuration in the tomcat server xml,java

It s common to want browsers to cache resources JavaScript CSS images etc until there is a new version available and then ensure that the browser fetches and caches the new version instead One solution is to embed a version number in the resource s filename but will placing the resources to be managed in this way in a directory with a revision number in it do the same thing Is the whole URL to the file used as a key in the browser s cache or is it just the filename itself and some meta data If my code changes from fetching r20 example js to r21 example js can I be sure that revision 20 of example js was cached but now revision 21 has been fetched instead and it is now cached,javascript

I ve recently inherited an application that makes very heavy use of session including storing a lot of custom data objects in session One of my first points of business with this application was to at least move the session data away from InProc and off load it to either a stateserver or SQL Server After I made all of the appropriate data objects serializable and changed the web config to use a state service everything appeared to work fine However I found that this application does a lot of object comparisons using GetHashCode Methods that worked fine when the session was InProc no longer work because the HashCodes no longer match when they are supposed to This appears to be the case when trying to find a specific child object from a parent when you know the child object s original hash code If I simply change the web config back to using inproc it works again Anyone have any thoughts on where to begin with this EDIT qbeuek thanks for the quick reply In regards to The default implementation of GetHashCode in Object class return a hash value based on objects address in memory or something similar If some other identity comparison is required you have to override both Equals and GetHashCode I should have given more information on how they are using this Basically they have one parent data object and there are several arrays of child objects They happen to know the hash code for a particular object they need so they are looping through a specific array of child objects looking for a hash code that matches Once a match is found they then use that object for other work,csharp

I have a java app not running in any application container which listens on a ServerSocket for connections I would like it to only accept connections which come from localhost Currently after a connection is accepted it checks the peer IP and rejects it if it is not the loopback address but I know that peer IP addresses can be spoofed So if possible I d prefer to bind to a socket that only listens on the loopback interface is this possible I ve tried a few different things such as specifying 127 0 0 1 as the local address when calling bind with no luck Thanks in advance Thank you all for your help I m embarrassed to admit that this was all my mistake Our application listens on two different ports and I was binding one to the loopback interface but testing against the other When I actually try to telnet to the correct port everything works fine i e binding to 127 0 0 1 does exactly what it s supposed to As for spoofing the loopback address you guys are right I shouldn t have made it sound like the primary concern Really the desired behavior is to only take local connections and binding to only the local interface is a more direct way of achieving that than accepting all connections and then closing non local ones,java

One thing I am concerned with is that I discovered two ways of registering delegates to events OnStuff this Handle OnStuff new StuffEventHandler this Handle The first one is clean and it makes sense doing OnStuff this Handle to unregister from the event But with the latter case should I do OnStuff new StuffEventHandler this Handle It feels like I am not removing anything at all since I m throwing in another StuffEventHandler reference Does the event compare the delegate by reference I am concerned I could start a nasty memory pool here Get me I don t have the reference to the new StuffEventHandler I previously registered What is the downside of doing 1 What is benefit of doing 2,csharp

This question comes out of the discussion on tuples I started thinking about the hash code that a tuple should have What if we will accept KeyValuePair class as a tuple It doesn t override the GetHashCode method so probably it won t be aware of the hash codes of it s children So run time will call Object GetHashCode which is not aware of the real object structure Then we can make two instances of some reference type which are actually Equal because of the overloaded GetHashCode and Equals And use them as children in tuples to cheat the dictionary But it doesn t work Run time somehow figures out the structure of our tuple and calls the overloaded GetHashCode of our class How does it work What s the analysis made by Object GetHashCode Can it affect the performance in some bad scenario when we use some complicated keys probably impossible scenario but still Consider this code as an example namespace csharp_tricks class Program class MyClass int keyValue int someInfo public MyClass int key int info keyValue key someInfo info public override bool Equals object obj MyClass other obj as MyClass if other null return false return keyValue Equals other keyValue public override int GetHashCode return keyValue GetHashCode static void Main string args Dictionary lt object object gt dict new Dictionary lt object object gt dict Add new KeyValuePair lt MyClass object gt new MyClass 1 1 1 1 here we get the exception an item with the same key was already added but how did it figure out the hash code dict Add new KeyValuePair lt MyClass object gt new MyClass 1 2 1 1 return Update I think I ve found an explanation for this as stated below in my answer The main outcomes of it are Be careful with your keys and their hash codes For complicated dictionary keys you must override Equals and GetHashCode correctly,csharp

I am looking for an open source Java based raytracing system suitable for use in modeling underwater ray based acoustics Such a package might be similar to the Comprehensive Acoustic System Simulation CASS with the Gaussian Ray Bundle GRAB but I would prefer an open source free to use or free to modify model that I can use in presentations to an open forum e g JavaOne The best model for my needs would provide ray path modeling based on an environmental model bathymetry also known as ocean bottom topography and emitter frequency spectra Note multipath effects including reflection and refraction are my primary points of interest so the best package would provide that right out of the box Slightly less optimal would be a standard Java based ray tracing package optical or acoustic that can handle a a varying speed through the medium Another way of saying this would be that the index of refraction varies in a continuous fashion throughout the medium though its first derivative might not be continuous,java

We have a web application that was implemented using GWT What it presents is fetched from a Jboss Seam server using the remoting mechanism and this works fine However the application is now extended to support sessions and users The Seam GWT service doesn t seem to provide a way to let me log in such that Seam can return restricted data back to the GWT application and so it looks to me that I will have to wrap the GWT application in facelets It is not obvious to me that a login using the Seam session mechanism will help me get correct data into the GWT application however so my question is whether I will be lucky and it will just work or if I need to do some client side magic server side magic or if my perception of missing login functionality in the Seam GWT service actually is wrong Bonus points to anyone that can provide me with a complete example showing something similar,java

It has always bothered me that the only way to copy a file in Java involves opening streams declaring a buffer reading in one file looping through it and writing it out to the other steam The web is littered with similar yet still slightly different implementations of this type of solution Is there a better way that stays within the bounds of the Java language meaning does not involve exec ing OS specific commands Perhaps in some reliable open source utility package that would at least obscure this underlying implementation and provide a one line solution,java
I m trying to write a console as in terminal not gaming console pong game in python and I m having trouble figuring how best to re draw the game I was thinking of having an 2d array as a sort of bitmap editing the array to reflect the ball paddles new positions and then casting each row to a string and printing it However that means that the old frames will remain and if the dimensions of the game are smaller than the console window old frames will still be visible Is there a way to delete characters from the console b I ve heard is unreliable Or is there an easier alternative route to outputting to the console for this sort of app,python
Greetings I m looking for a way to parse a number of XML files in a particular directory with ASP NET C I d like to be able to return content from particular elements but before that need to find those that have a certain value between an element Example XML file 1 lt file gt lt title gt Title 1 lt title gt lt someContent gt Content lt someContent gt lt filter gt filter lt filter gt lt file gt Example XML file 2 lt file gt lt title gt Title 2 lt title gt lt someContent gt Content lt someContent gt lt filter gt filter different filter lt filter gt lt file gt Example case 1 Give me all XML that has a filter of filter Example case 2 Give me all XML that has a title of Title 1 Looking it seems this should be possible with LINQ but I ve only seen examples on how to do this when there is one XML file not when there are multiples such as in this case I would prefer that this be done on the server side so that I can cache on that end Functionality from any version of the NET Framework can be used Thanks James,csharp

I have subclassed Form to include some extra functionality which boils down to a List lt Image gt which displays in a set of predefined spots on the form I have the following public class ButtonForm Form public class TitleButton public TitleButton does stuff here there s other stuff too just thought I should point out there s a default constructor private List lt TitleButton gt _buttons new List lt TitleButton gt public List lt TitleButton gt TitleButtons get return _buttons set _buttons value Other stuff here Then my actual form that I want to use is a subclass of ButtonForm instead of Form This all works great Designer even picks up the new property and shows it up on the property list I thought this would be great It showed the collection I could add the buttons into there and away I would go So I opened the collection editor added in all the objects and lo and behold there sitting in the designer was a picture perfect view of what I wanted This is where it starts to get ugly For some reason or another Designer refuses to actually generate code to create the objects and attach them to the collection so while it looks great in Design mode as soon as I compile and run it it all disappears again and I m back to square one I m at a total loss as to why this would happen if the Designer can generate it well enough to get a picture perfect view of my form with the extra behaviour why can t won t it generate the code into the actual code file,csharp

I ve created a forum and we re implementing an apc and memcache caching solution to save the database some work I started implementing the cache layer with keys like Categories getAll and if I had user specific data I d append the keys with stuff like the user ID so you d get User getFavoriteThreads 1471 When a user added a new favorite thread I d delete the cache key and it would recreate the entry However and here comes the problem I wanted to cache the threads in a forum Simple enough Forum getThreads iForumId But With pagination I d have to split this into several cache entries for example Forum getThreads iForumId iLimit iOffset Which is alright until someone posts a new thread in the forum I will now have to delete all the keys under Forum getThreads iForumId no matter what the limit and offset is What would be a good way of solving this problem I d really rather not loop through every possible limit and offset until I find something that doesn t match anymore Thanks,php

Is it possible to have one appBase served up by multiple context paths in Tomcat I have an application base that recently replaced a second application base My problem is a number of users still access the old context I would like to serve the now common application from a single appBase yet accessed via either context I took a swing at the low lying fruit and used a symbolic link in the webapps directory pointing the old context path at the new context path it works but feels cheezy And I don t like that a database connection pool is created for both contexts I would like to minimize the resources for connecting to the database Anyway if anyone knows of the proper way to do this I will greatly appreciate it I m using Tomcat 6 0 16 no apache front end I suppose URL rewrite would be nice,java
What s the difference between file and open in Python When should I use which one Say I m in 2 5,python
I have the following situation class A public A int whichFoo int foo1 int foo2 int foo3 int callFoo cals one of the foo s depending on the value of whichFoo In my current implementation I save the value of whichFoo in a data member in the constructor and use a switch in callFoo to decide which of the foo s to call Alternatively I can use a switch in the constructor to save a pointer to the right fooN to be called in callFoo My question is which way is more efficient if an object of class A is only constructed once while callFoo is called a very large number of times So in the first case we have multiple executions of a switch statement while in the second there is only one switch and multiple calls of a member function using the pointer to it I know that calling a member function using a pointer is slower than just calling it directly Does anybody know if this overhead is more or less than the cost of a switch Clarification I realize that you never really know which approach gives better performance until you try it and time it However in this case I already have approach 1 implemented and I wanted to find out if approach 2 can be more efficient at least in principle It appears that it can be and now it makes sense for me to bother to implement it and try it Oh and I also like approach 2 better for aesthetic reasons I guess I am looking for a justification to implement it,cpp

I m experiencing an issue on a test machine running Red Hat Linux kernel version is 2 4 21 37 ELsmp using Java 1 6 1 6 0_02 or 1 6 0_04 The problem is once a certain number of threads are created in a single thread group the operating system is unwilling or unable to create any more This seems to be specific to Java creating threads as the C thread limit program was able to create about 1 5k threads Additionally this doesn t happen with a Java 1 4 JVM it can create over 1 4k threads though they are obviously being handled differently with respect to the OS In this case the number of threads it s cutting off at is a mere 29 threads This is testable with a simple Java program that just creates threads until it gets an error and then prints the number of threads it created The error is a java lang OutOfMemoryError unable to create new native thread This seems to be unaffected by things such as the number of threads in use by other processes or users or the total amount of memory the system is using at the time JVM settings like Xms Xmx and Xss don t seem to change anything either which is expected considering the issue seems to be with native OS thread creation The output of ulimit a is as follows core file size blocks c 0 data seg size kbytes d unlimited file size blocks f unlimited max locked memory kbytes l 4 max memory size kbytes m unlimited open files n 1024 pipe size 512 bytes p 8 stack size kbytes s 10240 cpu time seconds t unlimited max user processes u 7168 virtual memory kbytes v unlimited The user process limit does not seem to be the issue Searching for information on what could be wrong has not turned up much but this post seems to indicate that at least some Red Hat kernels limit a process to 300 MB of memory allocated for stack and at 10 MB per thread for stack it seems like the issue could be there though it seems strange and unlikely as well I ve tried changing the stack size with ulimit s to test this but any value other than 10240 and the JVM does not start with an error of Error occurred during initialization of VM Cannot create VM thread Out of system resources I can generally get around Linux but I really don t know much about system configuration and I haven t been able to find anything specifically addressing this kind of situation Any ideas on what system or JVM settings could be causing this would be appreciated Edits Running the thread limit program mentioned by plinth there was no failure until it tried to create the 1529th thread The issue also did not occur using a 1 4 JVM does occur with 1 6 0_02 and 1 6 0_04 JVMs can t test with a 1 5 JVM at the moment The code for the thread test I m using is as follows public class ThreadTest public static void main String pArgs throws Exception try keep spawning new threads forever while true new TestThread start when out of memory error is reached print out the number of successful threads spawned and exit catch OutOfMemoryError e System out println TestThread CREATE_COUNT System exit 1 static class TestThread extends Thread private static int CREATE_COUNT 0 public TestThread CREATE_COUNT make the thread wait for eternity after being spawned public void run try sleep Integer MAX_VALUE even if there is an interruption dont do anything catch InterruptedException e If you run this with a 1 4 JVM it will hang when it can t create any more threads and require a kill 9 at least it did for me More Edit It turns out that the system that is having the problem is using the LinuxThreads threading model while another system that works fine is using the NPTL model,java

On our web application the search results are displayed in sortable tables The user can click on any column and sort the result The problem is some times the user does a broad search and gets a lot of data returned To make the sortable part work you probably need all the results which takes a long time Or I can retrieve few results at a time but then sorting won t really work well What s the best practice to display sortable tables that might contain lots of data Thanks for all the advises I will certainly going over these We are using an existing Javascript framework that has the sortable table lots of results means hundreds The problem is that our users are at some remote site and a lot of delay is the network time to send receive data from the data center Sorting the data at the database side and only send one page worth of results at a time is nice but when the user clicks some column header another round trip is done which always add 3 4 seconds Well I guess that might be the network team s problem,javascript
I have few asynchronous tasks running and I need to wait until at least one of them is finished in the future probably I ll need to wait util M out of N tasks are finished Currently they are presented as Future so I need something like Blocks current thread until one of specified futures is done and returns it public static lt T gt Future lt T gt waitForAny Collection lt Future lt T gt gt futures throws AllFuturesFailedException Is there anything like this Or anything similar not necessary for Future Currently I loop through collection of futures check if one is finished then sleep for some time and check again This looks like not the best solution because if I sleep for long period then unwanted delay is added if I sleep for short period then it can affect performance I could try using new CountDownLatch 1 and decrease countdown when task is complete and do countdown await but I found it possible only if I control Future creation It is possible but requires system redesign because currently logic of tasks creation sending Callable to ExecutorService is separated from decision to wait for which Future I could also override lt T gt RunnableFuture lt T gt AbstractExecutorService newTaskFor Callable lt T gt callable and create custom implementation of RunnableFuture with ability to attach listener to be notified when task is finished then attach such listener to needed tasks and use CountDownLatch but that means I have to override newTaskFor for every ExecutorService I use and potentially there will be implementation which do not extend AbstractExecutorService I could also try wrapping given ExecutorService for same purpose but then I have to decorate all methods producing Futures All these solutions may work but seem very unnatural It looks like I m missing something simple like WaitHandle WaitAny WaitHandle waitHandles in c Are there any well known solutions for such kind of problem UPDATE Originally I did not have access to Future creation at all so there were no elegant solution After redesigning system I got access to Future creation and was able to add countDownLatch countdown to execution process then I can countDownLatch await and everything works fine Thanks for other answers I did not know about ExecutorCompletionService and it indeed can be helpful in similar tasks but in this particular case it could not be used because some Futures are created without any executor actual task is sent to another server via network completes remotely and completion notification is received,java

I m using Windows Vista and C net 3 5 but I had my friend run the program on XP and has the same problem So I have a C program that I have running in the background with an icon in the SystemTray I have a low level keyboard hook so when I press two keys Ctr windows in this case it ll pull of the application s main form The form is set to be full screen in the combo key press even handler this FormBorderStyle FormBorderStyle None this WindowState FormWindowState Maximized So it basically works When I hit CTR Windows it brings up the form no matter what program I have given focus to But sometimes the taskbar will still show up over the form which I don t want I want it to always be full screen when I hit that key combo I figure it has something to do with what application has focus originally But even when I click on my main form the taskbar sometimes stays there So I wonder if focus really is the problem It just seems like sometimes the taskbar is being stubborn and doesn t want to sit behind my program Anyone have any ideas how I can fix this EDIT More details I m trying to achieve the same effect that a web browser has when you put it into fullscreen mode or when you put powerpoint into presentation mode In a windows form you do that by putting the border style to none and maximizing the window But sometimes the window won t cover the taskbar for some reason Half the time it will If I have the main window topmost the others will fall behind it when I click on it which I don t want if the taskbar is hidden,csharp
I m trying to teach Komodo to fire up IDLE when I hit the right keystrokes I can use the exact path of the shortcut in start menu in the Windows Explorer location bar to launch IDLE so I was hoping Komodo would be able to use it as well But giving this path to Komodo causes it to say that 1 is returned This appears to be a failure as IDLE doesn t start up I thought I d avoid the shortcut and just use the exact path I go to the start menu find the shortcut for IDLE right click to look at the properties The target is grayed out but says Python 2 5 2 The Start in is set to C Python25 The Open File Location button is also grayed out How do I find out where this shortcut is really pointing I have tried starting python exe and pythonw exe both in C Python25 but neither starts up IDLE,python

First of all I m fairly sure snapping to grid is fairly easy however I ve run into some odd trouble in this situation and my maths are too weak to work out specifically what is wrong Here s the situation I have an abstract concept of a grid with Y steps exactly Y_STEP apart the x steps are working fine so ignore them for now The grid is in an abstract coordinate space and to get things to line up I ve got a magic offset in there let s call it Y_OFFSET to snap to the grid I ve got the following code python def snapToGrid originalPos offset step index int originalPos offset step truncates the remainder away return index gap offset so I pass the cursor position Y_OFFSET and Y_STEP into that function and it returns me the nearest floored y position on the grid That appears to work fine in the original scenario however when I take into account the fact that the view is scrollable things get a little weird Scrolling is made as basic as I can get it I ve got a viewPort that keeps count of the distance scrolled along the Y Axis and just offsets everything that goes through it Here s a snippet of the cursor s mouseMotion code def mouseMotion self event pixelPos event pos Y odePos Scroll pixelPosToOdePos pixelPos self tool positionChanged odePos So there s two things to look at there first the Scroll module s translation from pixel position to the abstract coordinate space then the tool s positionChanged function which takes the abstract coordinate space value and snaps to the nearest Y step Here s the relevant Scroll code def pixelPosToOdePos pixelPos offsetPixelPos pixelPos self viewPortOffset return pixelsToOde offsetPixelPos def pixelsToOde pixels return float pixels float pixels_in_an_ode_unit And the tools update code def positionChanged self newPos self snappedPos snapToGrid originalPos Y_OFFSET Y_STEP The last relevant chunk is when the tool goes to render itself It goes through the Scroll object which transforms the tool s snapped coordinate space position into an onscreen pixel position here s the code in Tool def render self screen Scroll render screen self image self snappedPos in Scroll def render self screen image odePos pixelPos self odePosToPixelPos odePos screen blit image pixelPos screen is a surface from pygame for the curious def odePosToPixelPos self odePos offsetPos odePos self viewPortOffset return odeToPixels offsetPos def odeToPixels odeUnits return int odeUnits pixels_in_an_ode_unit Whew that was a long explanation Hope you re still with me The problem I m now getting is that when I scroll up the drawn image loses alignment with the cursor It starts snapping to the Y step exactly 1 step below the cursor Additionally it appears to phase in and out of allignment At some scrolls it is out by 1 and other scrolls it is spot on It s never out by more than 1 and it s always snapping to a valid grid location Best guess I can come up with is that somewhere I m truncating some data in the wrong spot but no idea where or how it ends up with this behavior Anyone familiar with coordinate spaces scrolling and snapping,python
I had assumed that the canonical form for operator assuming the existence of an overloaded operator member function was like this const T operator const T amp lhs const T amp rhs return T lhs rhs But it was pointed out to me that this would also work const T operator T lhs const T amp rhs return lhs rhs In essence this form transfers creation of the temporary from the body of the implementation to the function call It seems a little awkward to have different types for the two parameters but is there anything wrong with the second form Is there a reason to prefer one over the other,cpp

I d like to line up items approximately like this item1 item2 i3 longitemname i4 longitemname2 anotheritem i5 Basically items of varying length arranged in a table like structure The tricky part is the container for these can vary in size and I d like to fit as many as I can in each row in other words I won t know beforehand how many items fit in a line and if the page is resized the items should re flow themselves to accommodate E g initially 10 items could fit on each line but on resize it could be reduced to 5 I don t think I can use an html table since I don t know the number of columns since I don t know how many will fit on a line I can use css to float them but since they re of varying size they won t line up So far the only thing I can think of is to use javascript to get the size of largest item set the size of all items to that size and float everything left Any better suggestions,javascript

In order to help my team write testable code I came up with this simple list of best practices for making our C code base more testable Some of the points refer to limitations of Rhino Mocks a mocking framework for C but the rules may apply more generally as well Does anyone have any best practices that they follow To maximize the testability of code follow these rules Write the test first then the code Reason This ensures that you write testable code and that every line of code gets tests written for it Design classes using dependency injection Reason You cannot mock or test what cannot be seen Separate UI code from its behavior using Model View Controller or Model View Presenter Reason Allows the business logic to be tested while the parts that can t be tested the UI is minimized Do not write static methods or classes Reason Static methods are difficult or impossible to isolate and Rhino Mocks is unable to mock them Program off interfaces not classes Reason Using interfaces clarifies the relationships between objects An interface should define a service that an object needs from its environment Also interfaces can be easily mocked using Rhino Mocks and other mocking frameworks Isolate external dependencies Reason Unresolved external dependencies cannot be tested Mark as virtual the methods you intend to mock Reason Rhino Mocks is unable to mock non virtual methods,csharp

Not sure if this is possible or if I m expressing correctly what I m looking for but I have the following piece of code in my library repeatedly and would like to practice some DRY I have set of SQL Server tables that I m querying based on a simple user supplied search field ala Google I m using LINQ to compose the final query based on what s in the search string I m looking for a way to use generics and passed in lambda functions to create a reusable routine out of this string arrayOfQueryTerms getsTheArray var somequery from q in dataContext MyTable select q if arrayOfQueryTerms Length 1 somequery somequery Where lt MyTableEntity gt e gt e FieldName StartsWith arrayOfQueryTerms 0 else foreach string queryTerm in arrayOfQueryTerms if String IsNullOrEmpty queryTerm somequery somequery Where lt MyTableEntity gt e gt e FieldName Contains queryTerm I was hoping to create a generic method with signature that looks something like private IQueryable lt T gt getQuery T MyTableEntity string arrayOfQueryTerms Func lt T bool gt predicate I m using the same search strategy across all my tables so the only thing that really differs from usage to usage is the MyTable amp MyTableEntity searched and the FieldName searched Does this make sense Is there a way with LINQ to dynamically pass in the name of the field to query in the where clause Or can I pass in this as a predicate lambda e gt e FieldName Contains queryTerm I realize there a million and a half ways to do this in SQL probably easier but I d love to keep everything in the LINQ family for this one Also I feel that generics should be handy for a problem like this Any ideas,csharp

I have an immutable class with some private fields that are set during the constructor execution I want to unit test this constructor but I m not sure the best practice in this case Simple Example This class is defined in Assembly1 public class Class2Test private readonly string _StringProperty public Class2Test _StringProperty ConfigurationManager AppSettings stringProperty This class is defined in Assembly2 TestClass public class TestClass TestMethod public void Class2Test_Default_Constructor Class2Test x new Class2Test what do I assert to validate that the field was set properly EDIT 1 I have answered this question with a potential solution but I m not sure if it s the right way to go So if you think you have a better idea please post it This example isn t really worth testing but assume the constructor has some more complex logic Is the best approach to avoid testing the constructor and to just assume it works if all the tests for the methods on the class work EDIT 2 Looks like I made the sample a little to simple I have updated it with a more reasonable situation,csharp

I ve been writing a little application that will let people upload amp download files to me I ve added a web service to this applciation to provide the upload download functionality that way but I m not too sure on how well my implementation is going to cope with large files At the moment the definitions of the upload amp download methods look like this written using Apache CXF boolean uploadFile WebParam name username String username WebParam name password String password WebParam name filename String filename WebParam name fileContents byte fileContents throws UploadException LoginException byte downloadFile WebParam name username String username WebParam name password String password WebParam name filename String filename throws DownloadException LoginException So the file gets uploaded and downloaded as a byte array But if I have a file of some stupid size e g 1GB surely this will try and put all that information into memory and crash my service So my question is is it possible to return some kind of stream instead I would imagine this isn t going to be terribly OS independent though Although I know the theory behind web services the practical side is something that I still need to pick up a bit of information on Cheers for any input Lee,java
Here s the scenario You have a Windows server that users remotely connect to via RDP You want your program which runs as a service to know who is currently connected This may or may not include an interactive console session Please note that this is the not the same as just retrieving the current interactive user I m guessing that there is some sort of API access to Terminal Services to get this info,csharp
I m a jQuery novice so the answer to this may be quite simple I have an image and I would like to do several things with it When a user clicks on a Zoom icon I m running the imagetool plugin http code google com p jquery imagetool to load a larger version of the image The plugin creates a new div around the image and allows the user to pan around When a user clicks on an alternative image I m removing the old one and loading in the new one The problem comes when a user clicks an alternative image and then clicks on the zoom button the imagetool plugin creates the new div but the image appears after it The code is as follows Product Zoom jQuery document ready function productZoom click function Set new image src var imageSrc productZoom attr href productImage attr src imageSrc Run the imagetool plugin on the image function productImage imagetool viewportWidth 300 viewportHeight 300 topX 150 topY 150 bottomX 450 bottomY 450 return false Alternative product photos jQuery document ready function altPhoto click function productImageDiv div viewport remove productImage remove Set new image src var altImageSrc this attr href productZoom attr href altImageSrc var img new Image img load function this hide productImageDiv append this this fadeIn error function notify the user that the image could not be loaded attr src altImageSrc id productImage return false It seems to me that the imagetool plugin can no longer see the productImage image once it has been replaced with a new image So I think this has something to do with binding As in because the new image is added to the dom after the page has loaded the iamgetool plugin can no longer use it correctly is this right If so any ideas how to deal with it,javascript

The ThreadStatic attribute declares a static variable as unique per thread Do you know an easy pattern to correctly dispose such variables What we used before ThreadStatic is a ThreadContextManager Every thread was allocated a ThreadContext which retained all thread specific information We spawned some threads and let them work Then when they all finished we disposed of the ThreadContentManager which in turn disposed all the contexts if they were IDisposable I don t see an immediate way to translate this pattern to ThreadStatic objects The objects will be disposed of eventualy because the threads die and so nothing reference them However we prefer deterministic dispose whenever possible Update I do not really control the threads directly I m using Microsoft CCR which has a ThreadPool that does tasks When all the tasks are done I m disposing the Dispatcher which holds the threadpool The thing is I do not get a chance to do anything at the end of a thread s main function so I can t dispose things manually at the end of a thread s run Can I access the thread s static objects from outside the thread somehow,csharp
Recently I noticed my application appears to be eating memory that never gets released After profiling with CLRProfiler I ve found that the Castle Windsor container I m using is holding onto objects These objects are declared with the lifestyle transient attribute in the config xml I ve found if I put an explicit call to IWindsorContainer Release hangingObject that it will drop its references This is causing a problem though I wasn t expecting that with a transient lifestyle object CastleWindsor would keep a reference and effectively create a leak It s going to be a rather mundane and error prone task going around inserting explicit Release calls in all the appropriate places Have you seen this problem and do you have any suggestions for how to get around it,csharp
I would like to code a little program which visually illustrates the behavior of the volatile keyword Ideally it should be a program which performs concurrent access to a non volatile static field and which gets incorrect behavior because of that Adding the volatile keyword in the same program should fix the problem That something I didn t manage to achieve Even trying several times enabling optimization etc I always get a correct behavior without the volatile keyword Do you have any idea about this topic Do you know how to simulate such a problem in a simple demo app Does it depend on hardware,csharp

I ve set the MaxDate and MinDate properties of a DateTimePicker However when I test the control at runtime there is no way to tell the invalid dates from the valid ones The only difference is that clicking on an invalid date does nothing This is not very intuitive for the user I want to be able to tell at a glance what the valid dates are Is there any way to highlight the valid date range or more appropriately dim the invalid dates Or is there another control which would be more appropriate I m sure a couple of combo boxes would work but I really think the user should be presented with a calendar control when asked for a date CONTEXT This is a WinForms charting application The range of valid data is fixed new data is added via another process The user needs to pick a date and time for the chart s start time as well as a duration which is handled separately,csharp

When generating XML from XmlDocument in NET a blank xmlns attribute appears the first time an element without an associated namespace is inserted how can this be prevented Example XmlDocument xml new XmlDocument xml AppendChild xml CreateElement root whatever name space 1 0 xml DocumentElement AppendChild xml CreateElement loner Console WriteLine xml OuterXml Output lt root xmlns whatever name space 1 0 gt lt loner xmlns gt lt root gt Desired Output lt root xmlns whatever name space 1 0 gt lt loner gt lt root gt Is there a solution applicable to the XmlDocument code not something that occurs after converting the document to a string with OuterXml My reasoning for doing this is to see if I can match the standard XML of a particular protocol using XmlDocument generated XML The blank xmlns attribute may not break or confuse a parser but it s also not present in any usage that I ve seen of this protocol,csharp
When creating a class that has internal private methods usually to reduce code duplication that don t require the use of any instance fields are there performance or memory advantages to declaring the method as static Example foreach XmlElement element in xmlDoc DocumentElement SelectNodes sample string first GetInnerXml element first string second GetInnerXml element second string third GetInnerXml element third private static string GetInnerXml XmlElement element string nodeName return GetInnerXml element nodeName null private static string GetInnerXml XmlElement element string nodeName string defaultValue XmlNode node element SelectSingleNode nodeName return node null defaultValue node InnerXml Is there any advantage to declaring the GetInnerXml methods as static No opinion responses please I have an opinion,csharp
Background In my job we use SVN C and VisualStudio Part of my task regularly involves global renames Often I end up with a broken build after renaming something and then merging in changes The question is there a solution out there that can look at my changes notice the global rename and then apply that to the edit that others have made while merging them in Another way to get much the same effect would be some sort of refactor log and then apply that to the incoming edits The tool need not be perfect even if it just noted any references in their edits that referred to something that I have edited would be valuable Edit I m aware of VS s refactor tools What I m looking for is something that will allow me to after I have refactored my working copy apply the same refactorings to other peoples edits that I now need to merge in The ideal solution would be to make sure there are no outstanding edits when I do the refactoring but that would prevent anyone else from getting anything done for the next week or more Because they would have to sync every half hour or so for the next week,csharp

I have a several webapps which use java util logging Tomcat 5 5 is configured to use the Juli logger so that each webapp has its own log file The problem is that Juli does not have properties for maximum file size and file count Using Juli the files will grow unbounded and only roll at the end of the day Also an unlimited number of log files are retained You can see the FileHandler properties on this page Apache Tomcat 5 5 Documentation There is no limit or count property the following lines do nothing org apache juli FileHandler limit 102400 org apache juli FileHandler count 5 Without changing the webapps is there a way to get unique log files for each application with some type of bounds on the log file sizes UPDATE The solution I found was not use the Juli logger at all java util logging FileHandler limit 102400 java util logging FileHandler count 5 Thanks Greg,java
I m writing an app and our designers want to use gradients for some of the backgrounds on a few of our composites I wrote the following code composite addListener SWT Paint new Listener public void handleEvent Event e GC gc e gc Rectangle rect composite getClientArea Color color1 new Color display 0 0 0 Color color2 new Color display 255 255 255 gc setForeground color1 gc setBackground color2 gc fillGradientRectangle rect x rect y rect width rect height true This draws the gradient fine on the composite but we have Label CLabels Canvases and Links on top of the composite In these areas the background is just the plain gray you get when drawing an empty canvas I ve tried forcing the Labels to inherit the background like so label setBackgroundMode SWT INHERIT_DEFAULT SWT INHERIT_FORCE Doesn t work either But this leaves me with the same default gray and no gradient behind the components on top of the Composite Any suggestions for getting the gradient to be the background of each element I wouldn t be opposed to drawing the Gradient onto a gc with an image supplied and then setting the background to that Image However that method just hasn t been working at all composite or any of its elements Also it s not possible for me to set the gradient individually to my knowledge We want the whole composite to be one uniform flowing gradient edit I uploaded an example upto twitpic here Thanks Brian Gianforcaro,java
So why exactly is it that it s always recommended to use const as often as possible It seems to me that using const can be more of a pain than a help in C But then again I m coming at this from the python perspective if you don t want something to be changed don t change it So with that said here are a few questions It seems like every time I mark something as const I get an error and have to change some other function somewhere to be const too Then this causes me to have to change another function somewhere else Is this something that just gets easier with experience Are the benefits of using const really enough to compensate for the trouble If you don t intend on changing an object why not just not write code that doesn t change it I should note that at this point in time I m most focused on the benefits of using const for correctness and maintainability purposes although it is also nice to have an idea of the performance implications EDIT I m told that the correct term is const correctness so that s what the title is now,cpp
I have a problem which requires me to parse several log files from a remote machine There are a few complications 1 The file may be in use 2 The files can be quite large 100mb 3 Each entry may be multi line To solve the in use issue I need to copy it first I m currently copying it directly from the remote machine to the local machine and parsing it there That leads to issue 2 Since the files are quite large copying it locally can take quite a while To enhance parsing time I d like to make the parser multi threaded but that makes dealing with multi lined entries a bit trickier The two main issues are 1 How do i speed up the file transfer Compression Is transferring locally even neccessary Can I read an in use file some other way 2 How do i deal with multi line entries when splitting up the lines among threads UPDATE The reason I didnt do the obvious parse on the server reason is that I want to have as little cpu impact as possible I don t want to affect the performance of the system im testing,csharp

The following method does not work because the inner block declares a variable of the same name as one in the outer block Apparently variables belong to the method or class in which they are declared not to the block in which they are declared so I therefore can t write a short little temporary block for debugging that happens to push a variable in the outer scope off into shadow just for a moment void methodName int i 7 for int j 0 j lt 10 j int i j 2 Almost every block scoped language I ve ever used supported this including trivial little languages that I wrote interpreters and compilers for in school Perl can do this as can Scheme and even C Even PL SQL supports this What s the rationale for this design decision for Java Edit as somebody pointed out Java does have block scoping What s the name for the concept I m asking about I wish I could remember more from those language design classes,java

I have a loop that looks something like this for int i 0 i lt max i String myString float myNum Float parseFloat myString myFloats i myNum This is the main content of a method whose sole purpose is to return the array of floats I want this method to return null if there is an error so I put the loop inside a try catch block like this try for int i 0 i lt max i String myString float myNum Float parseFloat myString myFloats i myNum catch NumberFormatException ex return null But then I also thought of putting the try catch block inside the loop like this for int i 0 i lt max i String myString try float myNum Float parseFloat myString catch NumberFormatException ex return null myFloats i myNum Is there any reason performance or otherwise to prefer one over the other Edit The consensus seems to be that it is cleaner to put the loop inside the try catch possibly inside its own method However there is still debate on which is faster Can someone test this and come back with a unified answer,java
I m experimenting with generics and I m trying to create structure similar to Dataset class I have following code public struct Column lt T gt T value T originalValue public bool HasChanges get return value Equals originalValue public void AcceptChanges originalValue value public class Record Column lt int gt id Column lt string gt name Column lt DateTime gt someDate Column lt int gt someInt public bool HasChanges get return id HasChanges name HasChanges someDate HasChanges someInt HasChanges public void AcceptChanges id AcceptChanges name AcceptChanges someDate AcceptChanges someInt AcceptChanges Problem I have is that when I add new column I need to add it also in HasChanges property and AcceptChanges method This just asks for some refactoring So first solution that cames to my mind was something like this public interface IColumn bool HasChanges get void AcceptChanges public struct Column lt T gt IColumn public class Record Column lt int gt id Column lt string gt name Column lt DateTime gt someDate Column lt int gt someInt IColumn Columns get return new IColumn id name someDate someInt public bool HasChanges get bool has false IColumn columns Columns clone and boxing for int i 0 i lt columns Length i has columns i HasChanges return has public void AcceptChanges IColumn columns Columns clone and boxing for int i 0 i lt columns Length i columns i AcceptChanges Here we are changing clone As you can see from comments we have few problems here with struct cloning Simple solution to this is to change Column to class but from my tests it seems that it increases memory usage by 40 because of each object metadata which is not acceptable for me So my question is does anyone have any other ideas how to create methods that can work on different structured objects records Maybe someone from F community can suggest how such problems are solved in functional languages and how it impacts performance and memory usage Edit sfg thanks for suggestion about macros In Visual Studio 2008 there is built in but not so known template engine called T4 Tha whole point is to add tt file to my project and create a template that will search all my classes recognize somehow the ones that are records for example by some interface they implement and produce partial classes with HasChanges and AcceptChanges that will call only Columns the class contain Some usefull links T4 Editor for VS Blog with links and tutorials about T4 Blog entry with example that uses EnvDTE to read project files,csharp
I ve got a page with a normal form with a submit button and some jQuery which binds to the form submit event and overrides it with e preventDefault and runs an AJAX command This works fine when the submit button is clicked but when a link with onclick document formName submit is clicked the event is not caught by the AJAX form submit event handler Any ideas why not or how to get this working without binding to all the a elements,javascript

I m looking to create an ValidationRule class that validates properties on an entity type object I d really like to set the name of the property to inspect and then give the class a delegate or a lambda expression that will be evaluated at runtime when the object runs its IsValid method Does anyone have a snippet of something like this or any ideas on how to pass an anonymous method as an argument or property Also I m not sure if I m explaining what I m trying to accomplish so please ask questions if I m not being clear,csharp
Out of order execution in CPUs means that a CPU can reorder instructions to gain better performance and it means the CPU is having to do some very nifty bookkeeping and such There are other processor approaches too such as hyper threading Some fancy compilers understand the un interrelatedness of instructions to a limited extent and will automatically interleave instruction flows probably over a longer window than the CPU sees to better utilise the processor Deliberate compile time interleaving of floating and integer instructions is another example of this Now I have highly parallel task And I typically have an ageing single core x86 processor without hyper threading Is there a straight forward way to get my the body of my for loop for this highly parallel task to be interleaved so that two or more iterations are being done together This is slightly different from loop unwinding as I understand it My task is a virtual machine running through a set of instructions which I ll really simplify for illustration as void run int num for int n 0 n lt num n vm_t data n for int i 0 i lt data len i data insn i parse data insn i eval So the execution trail might look like this data 1 insn 0 parse data 1 insn 0 eval data 1 insn 1 parse data 2 insn 1 eval data 2 insn 2 parse data 2 insn 2 eval Now what I d like is to be able to do two or more iterations explicitly in parallel data 1 insn 0 parse data 2 insn 0 parse processor can do OOO as these two flow in data 1 insn 0 eval data 2 insn 0 eval OOO opportunity here too data 1 insn 1 parse data 2 insn 1 parse I know from profiling e g using Callgrind with simulate cache yes that parsing is about random memory accesses cache missing and eval is about doing ops in registers and then writing results back Each step is several thousand instructions long So if I can intermingle the two steps for two iterations at once the processor will hopefully have something to do whilst the cache misses of the parse step are occurring Is there some c template madness to get this kind of explicit parallelism generated Of course I can do the interleaving and even staggering myself in code but it makes for much less readable code And if I really want unreadable I can go so far as assembler But surely there is some pattern for this kind of thing,cpp
I have a method lets say private static String drawCellValue int maxCellLength String cellValue String align and as you can notice I have a parameter called align Inside this method I m going to have some if condition on whether the value is a left or right setting the parameter as String obviously I can pass any string value I would like to know if it s possible to have an Enum value as a method parameter and if so how Just in case someone thinks about this I thought about using a Boolean value but I don t really fancy it First how to associate true false with left right Ok I can use comments but I still find it dirty and secondly I might decide to add a new value like justify so if I have more than 2 possible values Boolean type is definitely not possible to use Any ideas,java
I ve create a WinForms control that inherits from System Windows Forms UserControl I ve got some custom events on the control that I would like the consumer of my control to be able to see I m unable to actually get my events to show up in the Events tab of the Properties window during design time This means the only way to assign the events is to programmatically write myUserControl MyCustomEvent new MyUserControl MyCustomEventHandler EventHandlerFunction this is fine for me I guess but when someone else comes to use my UserControl they are not going to know that these events exist unless they read the library doco yeah right I know the event will show up using Intellisense but it would be great if it could show in the properties window too,csharp
I am trying to write a cronjob controller so I can call one website and have all modules cronjob php executed Now my problem is how do I do that Would curl be an option so I also can count the errors and successes Update I guess I have not explained it enough What I want to do is have one file which I can call like from http server cronjob and then make it execute every application modules controller CronjobController php or have another way of doing it so all the cronjobs aren t at one place but at the same place the module is located This would offer me the advantage that if a module does not exist it does not try to run its cronjob Now my question is how would you execute all the modules CronjobController or would you do it a completly different way so it still stays modular And I want to be able to giveout how many cronjobs ran successfully and how many didn t,php
I m now in search for a Java Text to Speech TTS framework During my investigations I ve found several JSAPI1 0 partially compatible frameworks listed on JSAPI Implementations page as well as a pair of Java TTS frameworks which do not appear to follow JSAPI spec Mary Say It Now I ve also noted that currently no reference implementation exists for JSAPI Brief tests I ve done for FreeTTS first one listed in JSAPI impls page show that it is far from reading simple and obvious words examples ABC blackboard Other tests are currently in progress And here goes the question 6 actually Which of the Java based TTS frameworks have you used Which ones by your opinion are capable of reading the largest wordbase What about their voice quality What about their performance Which non Java frameworks with Java bindings are there on the scene Which of them would you recommend Thank you in advance for your comments and suggestions,java

My understanding is that C C produces native code to run on a particular machine architecture Conversely languages like Java and C run on top of a virtual machine which abstracts away the native architecture Logically it would seem impossible for Java or C to match the speed of C because of this intermediate step however I ve been told that the latest compilers hot spot can attain this speed or even exceed it Perhaps this is more of a compiler question than a language question but can anyone explain in plain English how it is possible for one of these virtual machine languages to perform better than a native language,csharp

In python you can use a tuple in a formatted print statement and the tuple values are used at the indicated positions in the formatted string For example gt gt gt a 1 Hello 7 2 gt gt gt print these are the values d s f a these are the values 1 Hello 7 200000 Is there some way to use any array or collection in a java printf statement in a similar way I ve looked at the documentation and it appears to have built in support for some types like Calendar but I don t see anything for collections If this isn t provided in java is there any java idiom that would be used in a case like this where you are populating collections and then printing the values from many collections using one format string other than just nested looping,java

I am supposed to provide my users a really simple way of capturing video clips out of my OpenGL application s main window I am thinking of adding buttons and or keyboard shortcuts for starting and stopping the capture when starting I could ask for a filename and other options if any It has to run in Windows XP Vista but I also wouldn t like to close the Linux door which I ve so far been able to keep open The application uses OpenGL fragment and shader programs the effects due to which I absolutely need to have in the eventual videos It looks to me like there might be even several different approaches that could potentially fulfill my requirements but I don t really know where I should start An encoding library with functions like startRecording filename stopRecording and captureFrame I could call captureFrame after every frame rendered or every second third whatever If doing so makes my program run slower it s not really a problem A standalone external program that can be programmatically controlled from my application After all a standalone program that can not be controlled almost does what I need But as said it should be really simple for the users to operate and I would appreciate seamlessness as well my application typically runs full screen Additionally it should be possible to distribute as part of the installation package for my application which I currently prepare using NSIS Use the Windows API to capture screenshots frame by frame then employ for example one of the libraries mentioned here It seems to be easy enough to find examples of how to capture screenshots in Windows however I would love a solution which doesn t really force me to get my hands super dirty on the WinAPI level Use OpenGL to render into an offscreen target then use a library to produce the video I don t know if this is even possible and I m afraid it might not be the path of least pain anyway In particular I would not like the actual rendering to take a different execution path depending on whether video is being captured or not Additionally I would avoid anything that might decrease the frame rate in the normal non capture mode If the solution were free in either sense of the word then that would be great but it s not really an absolute requirement In general the less bloat there is the better On the other hand for reasons beyond this question I cannot link in any GPL only code unfortunately Regarding the file format I cannot expect my users to start googling for any codecs but as long as also displaying the videos is easy enough for a basic level Windows user I don t really care what the format is However it would be great if it were possible to control the compression quality of the output Just to clarify I don t need to capture video from an external device like camcorder nor am I really interested in mouse movements even though getting them does not harm either There are no requirements regarding audio the application makes no noise whatsoever I write C using Visual Studio 2008 for this very application also taking benefit of GLUT and GLUI I have a solid understanding regarding C and linking in libraries and that sort of stuff but on the other hand OpenGL is quite new for me so far I ve really only learnt the necessary bits to actually get my job done I don t need a solution super urgently so feel free to take your time,cpp

I am working on an application that will sport a web based point of sale interface The point of sale PC I am not sure as of now whether it will run on Linux or Windows must have a fiscal printer attached to it but like any web app it is the server which processes all stuff Both server and PoS machines are on the same LAN I must send the sale data in real time and via the fiscal printer which uses the serial port so printing a PDF or even a web page is not an option I ve been told I could have a little app listening on web services on the client which in turn talks to the printer instead of the server or the browser but don t have a clue how to do it Also I ll most likely need to listen to any printer feedback coupon number for instance which is generated by the printer and hand it back to the server Any ideas,java

I am starting a project for which we will have a thin client sending requests and getting responses from a server We are still in the planning stages so we have a choice to settle on either an Eclipse based GUI Eclipse plugin or using GWT as a fromtend for the application I am not very familiar with Eclipse as a GUI Nor with GWT but do know normal Java What would be the main benefits and drawbacks of either approach Edit Addressing the questions posed The project if Eclipse based would be using the core Eclipse gui No coding tools just bare bones and the GUI would be packaged with it I have been looking at GWT and so far seems the best choice but still have some research to do Communication method is a variant of CORBA In house libraries,java

I m trying to use CSS under media print and JavaScript to print a one page document with a given piece of text made as large as possible while still fitting inside a given width The length of the text is not known beforehand so simply using a fixed width font is not an option To put it another way I m looking for proper resizing so that for example IIIII would come out in a much larger font size than WWWWW because I is much skinnier than W in a variable width font The closest I ve been able to get with this is using JavaScript to try various font sizes until the clientWidth is small enough This works well enough for screen media but when you switch to print media is there any guarantee that the 90 DPI I appear to get on my system i e I put the margins to 0 5in either side and for a text resized so that it fits just within that I get about 675 for clientWidth will be the same anywhere else How does a browser decide what DPI to use when converting from pixel measurements Is there any way I can access this information using JavaScript I would love it if this were just a CSS3 feature font size max for width 7 5in but if it is I haven t been able to find it,javascript

The more we use RAII in C the more we find ourselves with destructors that do non trivial deallocation Now deallocation finalization however you want to call it can fail in which case exceptions are really the only way to let anybody upstairs know of our deallocation problem But then again throwing destructors are a bad idea because of the possibility of exceptions being thrown during stack unwinding std uncaught_exception lets you know when that happens but not much more so aside from letting you log a message before termination there s not much you can do unless you re willing to leave your program in an undefined state where some stuff is deallocated finalized and some not One approach is to have no throw destructors But in many cases that just hides a real error Our destructor might for example be closing some RAII managed DB connections as a result of some exception being thrown and those DB connections might fail to close This doesn t necessarily mean we re ok with the program terminating at this point On the other hand logging and tracing these errors isn t really a solution for every case otherwise we would have had no need for exceptions to begin with With no throw destructors we also find ourselves having to create reset functions that are supposed to be called before destruction but that just defeats the whole purpose of RAII Another approach is just to let the program terminate as it s the most predictable thing you can do Some people suggest chaining exceptions so that more than one error can be handled at a time But I honestly never actually seen that done in C and I ve no idea how to implement such a thing So it s either RAII or exceptions Isn t it I m leaning toward no throw destructors mainly because it keeps things simple r But I really hope there s a better solution because as I said the more we use RAII the more we find ourselves using dtors that do non trivial things Appendix I m adding links to interesting on topic articles and discussions I ve found Throwing Destructors StackOverflow discussion on the problems with SEH StackOverflow discussion on throwing destructors thanks Martin York Joel on Exceptions SEH Considered Harmful CLR Exception Handling which also touches on exception chaining Herb Sutter on std uncaught_exception and why it s not as useful as you think Historical discussion on the matter with interesting participants long Stroustrup explaining RAII Andrei Alexandrescu s Scope Guard,cpp

I m working on an upgrade for an existing database that was designed without any of the code to implement the design being considered Now I ve hit a brick wall in terms of implementing the database design in code I m certain whether its a problem with the design of the database or if I m simply not seeing the correct solution on how to what needs to be done The basic logic stipulates the following Users access the online trainings by way of Seats Users can have multiple Seats Seats are purchased by companies and have a many to many relationship with Products A Product has a many to many relationship with Modules A Module has a many to many relationship with Lessons Lessons are the end users access for their training To muddy the waters for one reason or another some Users have multiple Seats that contain the same Products Certification takes place on a per Product basis not on a per Seat basis Users have a many to many relationship with lessons that stores their current status or score for the lesson Users certify for a Product when they complete all of the Lessons in all of the Modules for the Product It is also significant to know when all Lessons for a particular Module are completed by a User Some Seats will be for ReCertification meaning that Users that previously certified for a Product can sign up and take a recertification exam Due to Rule 11 Users can and will have multiple Certification records Edit When a User completes a Lesson scores better than 80 then the User has according to the current business logic completed the Lesson for all Products and all Seats that contain the Lesson The trouble that I keep running into with the current design and the business logic as I ve more or less described it is that I can t find a way to effectively tie whether a user has certified for a particular product and seat vs when they have not I keep hitting snags trying to establish which Products under which Seats have been certified for the User and which haven t Part of the problem is because if they are currently registered for multiple of the same Product under different Seats then I have to count the Product only once Below is a copy of the portion of the schema that s involved Any suggestions on how to improve the design or draw the association in code would be appreciated In case it matters this site is built on the LAMPP stack You can view the relevant portion of the database schema here http lpsoftware com problem_db_structure png,php

I run a browser based game at www darknovagames com Recently I ve been working on reformatting the site with CSS trying to get all of its pages to verify according to the HTML standard I ve been toying with this idea of having the navigation menu on the left AJAX the pages in rather than taking the user to a separate page each time requiring a reload of the title and nav bar which almost never change and I know that if I do so I will probably break the Forward Back buttons in the browser My question I guess is should I go ahead and AJAX the site thus requiring the user to use the sites navigation to play the game or should I leave the site as it currently stands and use standard hyperlinks and things for navigation The reason I ask I guess is that I built a forums system into the site and a lot of times I would want to link say to a particular topic within the forums I m also open to suggestions Is there a standard preferably without traditional frames way to make only the body area of the site reload while still changing the URL so that users can bookmark and forward back etc That could potentially solve my problem as well I m just asking for the best solution here not an answer to a specific question _ Thanks,javascript

I m putting together a little tool that some business people can run on their local filesystems since we don t want to setup a host for it Basically its just HTML Javascript using jQuery to pull some reports using REST from a 3rd party The problem is FF3 and IE don t allow the ajax call I get Access to restricted URI denied code 1012 Obviously its an XSS issue how do I work around it The data returned is in XML format I was trying to do it this way get productUrl function data alert data EDIT To be clear I m not setting up an internal host for this Way to much red tape and we CANNOT host this externally due to the data being retrieved EDIT 2 A little testing shows that I can use an IFRAME to make the request Does anyone know if there any downsides to using a hidden IFRAME,jquery

I have returned to php development from Moose and I really miss CLOS like object model for php Is there some kind of syntaxtic sugar which would allow me to write less code in php when dealing with objects Just to stress this requirement a bit more I don t want to write one thing in several places I can live with part of code being generated automatically but in the code that I have to see to develop I don t want to see redundant information which is just clutter think LISP macro if you really need more analogy So this part can be also called DSL if that makes more sense I would love to have at least roles mixins and some kind of introspection without re inventing the weel Code generators and auto loaders might be one way to solve at least part of this problem p s For JavaScript there is Joose so similar API would be very useful,php

This is a nut I m cracking these days Application I m working on has some advanced processing towards SQL One of the operations selects various metadata on the objects in the current context from different tables based on the item names in the collection For this a range of select from where in is executed and to prevent malicious SQL code Sql parameters are used for constructing the contents of the in clause However when the item collection for constructing the in clause is larger than 2100 items this fails due to the Sql Server limitation of max 2100 Sql parameters per query One approach I m trying out now is creating a temp table for storing all item names and then joining the table in the original query instead of using where in This has me scratching my head on how to populate the table with the item names stored in an Array in the NET code Surely there has to be some bulk way to insert everything rather than issuing a separate insert into for each item Other than that I m very much interested in alternative approaches for solving this issue Thanks a lot,csharp

Not too practical maybe but still interesting Having some abstract question on matrix multiplication I have quickly implemented a matrix for ints then tested my assumptions And here I noticed that just int matrix is not good if I occasionally want to use it with decimal or double Of course I could try just to cast all to double but that s not convenient way Continue with assumption we could have a bunch of objects we are able to add and multiply why don t use them in my matrix So just after considering it would be a Matrix class now I faced that generic T could not be used I need it to support some interface which could add and multiply And the problem is I could override operators in my class but I could not introduce an interface which would support operators And I have an operators in built in types but still no interface over them What would you do in such a case considering you do not want to duplicate worker class body Wrappers and implicit casting didn t help me much I m interested in a beautiful solution Thanks,csharp
In java when using SimpleDateFormat with the pattern yyyy MM dd T HH mm ss SSSZ the date is outputted as 2002 02 01T18 18 42 703 0700 In xquery when using the xs dateTime function it gives the error Invalid lexical value err FORG0001 with the above date In order for xquery to parse properly the date needs to look like 2002 02 01T18 18 42 703 07 00 node the 3rd position from end of string which is based on the ISO 8601 whereas Java date is based on the RFC 822 standard I would like to be able to easily specify the timezone in Java so that it will output the way that xquery wants Thanks,java

This is really only easy to explain with an example so to remove the intersection of a list from within a dict I usually do something like this a 1 2 3 4 exclusion 3 4 5 have to build up a new list or the iteration breaks toRemove for var in a iterkeys if var in exclusion toRemove append var for var in toRemove del a var This might seem like an unusual example but it s surprising the number of times I ve had to do something like this Doing this with sets would be much nicer but I clearly want to retain the values for the dict This method is annoying because it requires two loops and an extra array Is there a cleaner and more efficient way of doing this,python
I recently began profiling an osgi java application that I am writing using VisualVM One thing I have noticed is that when the application starts sending data to a client over JMS the number of loaded classes starts increasing at a steady rate The Heap size and the PermGen size remains constant however The number of classes never falls even after it stops sending data Is this a memory leak I think it is because the loaded classes have to be stored somewhere however the heap and permgen never increase even after I run the application for several hours For the screenshot of my profiling application go here,java
I have a class holding complex scientific computations It is set up to only allow a user to create a properly instantiated case To properly test the code however requires setting internal state variables directly since the reference documents supply this data in their test cases Done improperly however it can invalidate the state So I must have the ability a member function to set internal variables from the unit test programs But I want to strongly discourage normal users from calling this function Yes a determined user can muck with anything but I don t want to advertise that there is a way to do something wrong It would be nice to be able to tell Intellisense to not show the function for instance The best solution I have at the moment is to just name the function something like DangerousSet What other options do I have Follow Up I found David B s answer most useful to my situation Thanks Mufasa s suggestion to use reflection was great but harder to implement for me Chris suggestion of using a decorator was good but didn t pan out BFree s suggestion on XML is also good and was already in use but doesn t really solve the problem Finally BillTheLizard s suggestion that the problem is in the source documents is not something I can control International experts publish highly technical books and journal articles for use by their community The fact that they don t address my particular needs is a fact of life There simply are no alternative documents,csharp

Edit Now I need to solve this problem for real I did a little more investigation and came up with a number of things to reduce duplicate content I posted detailed code samples on my blog Reducing Duplicate Content with ASP NET MVC First post go easy if I ve marked this up wrong or tagged it badly P In Microsoft s new ASP NET MVC framework it seems there are two things that could cause your content to be served up at multiple URLs something which Google penalize for and will cause your PageRank to be split across them Case insensitive URLs Default URL You can set the default controller action to serve up for requests to the root of your domain Let s say we choose HomeController Index We end up with the following URLs serving up the same content mydomain com mydomain com Home Index Now if people start linking to both of these then PageRank would be split Google would also consider it duplicate content and penalize one of them to avoid duplicates in their results On top of this the URLs are not case sensitive so we actually get the same content for these URLs too mydomain com Home Index mydomain com home index mydomain com Home index mydomain com home Index the list goes on So the question How do I avoid these penalties I would like All requests for the default action to be redirected 301 status to the same url All URLs to be case sensitive Possible,csharp

This is really two questions but they are so similar and to keep it simple I figured I d just roll them together Firstly Given an established python project what are some decent ways to speed it up beyond just plain in code optimization Secondly When writing a program from scratch in python what are some good ways to greatly improve performance For the first question imagine you are handed a decently written project and you need to improve performance but you can t seem to get much of a gain through refactoring optimization What would you do to speed it up in this case short of rewriting it in something like C,python
I heard that you could right shift a number by 5 instead of using Math floor I decided to check its limits to make sure that it was a suitable replacement so I checked the following values and got the following results in Google Chrome 2 5 5 2 2 9999 5 2 2 999999999999999 5 2 15 9s 2 9999999999999999 5 3 16 9s After some fiddling I found out that the highest possible value of two which when right shifted by 5 would yield 2 is 2 9999999999999997779553950749686919152736663818359374999999    with the 9 repeating in Chrome and Firefox The number is 2 9999999999999997779    in IE My question is what is the significance of the number 0000000000000007779553950749686919152736663818359374 It s a very strange number and it really piqued my curiosity I ve been trying to find an answer or at least some kind of pattern but I think my problem lies in the fact that I really don t understand the bitwise operation I understand the idea in principle but shifting a bit sequence by 5 doesn t make any sense at all to me Any help is appreciated For the record the weird digit sequence changes with 2 x The highest possible values of the following numbers that still truncate properly for 0 0 9999999999999999444888487687421729788184165954589843749    for 1 1 9999999999999999888977697537484345957636833190917968749    for 2 3 x 99999999999999977795539507496869191527366638183593749    for 4 7 x 9999999999999995559107901499373838305473327636718749    for 8 15 x 999999999999999111821580299874767661094665527343749    and so forth,javascript

Is there anyway to upgrade the installed JRE in the system We are having 1 5 0_08 installed in out HP Unix system We have to upgrade this to 1 5 0_15 Is there a way to patch up the existing JRE and upgrade to a newer version Or can this only be achieved by installing the newer JRE and set this in the system PATH Thanks for your time Regards Vivek,java
There are numerous times you have an interface that accepts similar type arguments that have a separate domain logic meaning public static class Database public static bool HasAccess string userId string documentId return true Now it s quite easy to have someone key documentId instead of userId and vice versa One could prevent that by abstracting the data type of the arguments public class UserId public string Value get internal set public static implicit operator string UserId id return id Value public class DocumentId public string Value get internal set public static implicit operator string DocumentId id return id Value public static class Database public static bool HasAccess UserId userId DocumentId documentId return true This way you get a nice compiler warning if you type in arguments out of order UserId e new UserId Value a DocumentId d new DocumentId Value b Database HasAccess d e You also get the ability to change abstracted type in without affecting the rest of the system but that s not very likely Would abstracting type be a good idea to get more type safety The question relates to C solutions but short descriptions in other languages is welcome EDIT Removed the implicit cast from string and pointing finger at the C tag,csharp

There s a famous bug in Visual Studio that prevents you from using the form designer on a subclass of an abstract form This problem has already been elucidated and solved most elegantly by Urban Potato that s not the part I m having trouble with The trouble is I have duplicated the technique described by Urban Potato and included it in my project which happens to be pretty big and now every time I try to open the designer of my derived form I get that Microsoft frightfully sorry old chap but I m going to have to kill you now message reminiscent of Otto in A Fish Called Wanda that says Microsoft Visual Studio 2005 has encountered a problem and needs to close We are sorry for the inconvenience But here s the real kicker if you just ignore that message and stuff it away beyond the bottom right corner of the screen you can carry on working perfectly normally Just don t click the Send Error Report or Don t Send buttons coz then VS does close Still this phenomenon is highly annoying and I d very much like to be able to work without the feeling that my IDE is just looking for some really nasty way to get back at me for pooh poohing its sage advice to quit now or else Further useful info this same behavior can be duplicated on all other computers in my office it s nothing specific to my machine Obviously something in the project code is upsetting the IDE but at least I know the design pattern works coz after I ignore the crash message the designer works perfectly well I just don t know where to start looking for the thing that is causing this problem Any ideas Thanks,csharp

It appears that our implementation of using Quartz JDBCJobStore along with Spring Hibernate and Websphere is throwing unmanaged threads I have done some reading and found a tech article from IBM stating that the usage of Quartz with Spring will cause that They make the suggestion of using CommnonJ to address this issue I have done some further research and the only examples I have seen so far all deal with the plan old JobStore that is not in a database So I was wondering if anyone has an example of the solution for this issue Thanks,java
I m working with a combobox in a Swing based application and I m having a hard time figuring out what to do to differentiate between an ItemEvent that is generated from a user event vs one caused by the application For instance Lets say I have a combobox combo and I m listening for itemStateChanged events with my ItemListener listener When either a user changes the selection to item 2 or I execute the line pseudocode combo setSelection 2 it seems like I m not able to tell these events apart That said I m no Swing expert by any means so I thought I would ask Thanks,java

Method signature in Java public List lt String gt getFilesIn List lt File gt directories similar one in ruby def get_files_in directories In the case of Java the type system gives me information about what the method expects and delivers In Ruby s case I have no clue what I m supposed to pass in or what I ll expect to receive In Java the object must formally implement the interface In Ruby the object being passed in must respond to whatever methods are called in the method defined here This seems highly problematic Even with 100 accurate up to date documentation the Ruby code has to essentially expose its implementation breaking encapsulation OO purity aside this would seem to be a maintenance nightmare The Ruby code gives me no clue what s being returned I would have to essentially experiment or read the code to find out what methods the returned object would respond to Not looking to debate static typing vs duck typing but looking to understand how you maintain a production system where you have almost no ability to design by contract Update No one has really addressed the exposure of a method s internal implementation via documentation that this approach requires Since there are no interfaces if I m not expecting a particular type don t I have to itemize every method I might call so that the caller knows what can be passed in Or is this just an edge case that doesn t really come up,java

In our web app we use PHP5 2 6 PDO to connect to a SQL Server 2005 database and store Russian texts Database collation is Cyrillic_General_CI_AS table collation is Cyrillic_General_CI_AS column type is NVARCHAR MAX We tried connecting to a database using two following schemes both causing different problems PDO mssql dbh new PDO mssql host mssql_server dbname mssql_db mssql_login mssql_pwd in which case a result of a simple query like that SELECT field1 FROM tbl1 WHERE id 1 shows field1 data truncated to 255 bytes PDO odbc dbh new PDO odbc DSN myDSN UID mssql_login PWD mssql_pwd in which case a result of the same query shows full not truncated data but with question marks instead of Russian symbols Notes In the SQL Management Studio data is not truncated and Russian symbols are displayed properly as well We have Windows 2003 Enterprise Edition SP2 So what should we choose as a connection method and how to fix corresponding issues,php
While simple interface driven event notification frameworks in Java have been around since pre Cambrian times e g java beans PropertyChangeSupport it is becoming increasingly popular for frameworks to use annotation driven event notification instead For an example see JBossCache 2 2 The listener class has its listener methods annotated rather than conforming to a rigid interface This is rather easier to program to and easier to read since you don t have to write empty implementations of listener callbacks that you re not interested in and yes I know about listener adapter superclasses Here s a sample from the JBossCache docs CacheListener public class MyListener CacheStarted CacheStopped public void cacheStartStopEvent Event e switch e getType case Event Type CACHE_STARTED System out println Cache has started break case Event Type CACHE_STOPPED System out println Cache has stopped break NodeCreated NodeRemoved NodeVisited NodeModified NodeMoved public void logNodeEvent NodeEvent ne log An event on node ne getFqn has occured The problem with this is that it s very much more of an involved process writing the framework to support this sort of thing due to the annotation reflection nature of it So before I charge off down the road of writing a generic framework I was hoping someone had done it already Has anyone come across such a thing,java

I ve seen a lot of questions around that use improperly the expression C C The reasons in my opinion are Newbie C and C programmers probably don t understand the difference between the two languages People don t really care about it since they want a generic quick and dirty answer While C C could sometimes be interpreted as either C or C I think it s a big error C and C offer different approaches to programming and even if C code can be easily implemented into C programs I think that referring to two separate languages with that single expression C C is wrong It s true that some questions can be considered either as C or C ones anyway What do you think about it,cpp

I ve been playing with Seam 2 0 2 SP1 for a few weeks and I have most of the basics nailed down but I haven t come up with a decent solution to the following Suppose I have a form at foo xhtml with a rewrite rule such that URLs like foo seam id lt fooId gt are converted to foo lt fooId gt There s a commandButton on the form with an action of fooHome update I also have a navigation rule in foo page xml that redirects back to a nice bookmark friendly GET after a successful POST lt navigation from action fooHome update gt lt rule if outcome updated gt lt redirect view id foo xhtml gt lt param name id value fooHome instance id gt lt redirect gt lt rule gt lt navigation gt The problem is when a validation error occurs at which point the navigation rules get skipped and I end up at foo after the POST My question Is there a way to redirect on validation errors so I end up with a GET request for foo lt fooId gt instead of the POST to foo I tried rolling my own validation methods in fooHome returning a failed outcome but I don t really want invalid data getting past the validation phase and thus into the current conversation,java
I have an import from excel script as part of a CMS that previously ran without issue My shared hosting provider has recently upgraded their infrastructure including PHP from 5 1 to 5 2 6 and the script now returns Uninitialized string offset XXX in path scriptname php on line 27 XXX being a decreasing number from 512 and path scriptname php of course being the full path to script in question It returns this error for every line of the excel file Line 27 is just a return from within a function that is the first point at which the imported data is being processed function GetInt4d data pos return ord data pos ord data pos 1 lt lt 8 ord data pos 2 lt lt 16 ord data pos 3 lt lt 24 It finally implodes with a Fatal error Allowed memory size of 47185920 bytes exhausted tried to allocate 71 bytes in path scriptname php on line 133 There s nothing useful in Apache error logs I am stumped Anyone have any ideas of at least where to look Even knowing if it s likely to be something within my script or something to do with upgrade would be useful I had another issue with a different site on same provider that after upgrade couldn t write sessions to tmp directory since resolved but am pretty sure it s not that EDIT As it turned out that the answer was to do with the version of the parser being incompatible in some way with PHP 5 2 6 I thought it might be of use to someone that the parser in question is Spreadsheet Excel Reader,php

I have a lot of Java source code that requires custom pre processing I d like rid of it but that s not feasible right now so I m stuck with it Given that I have an unfortunate problem that shouldn t have existed in the first place how do I solve it using maven For the full story I m replacing a python based build system with a maven one so one improvement at a time please Fixing the non standard source code is harder and will come later Is it possible using any existing Maven plugins to actually alter the source files during compile time Obviously leaving the original unprocessed code alone To be clear by preprocessing I mean preprocessing in the same sense as antenna or a C compiler would preprocess the code and by custom I mean that it s completely proprietary and looks nothing at all like C or antenna preprocessing,java

So NET 3 0 3 5 provides us with lots of new ways to query sort and manipulate data thanks to all the neat functions supplied with LINQ Sometimes I need to compare user defined types that don t have a built in comparison operator In many cases the comparison is really simple something like foo1 key foo2 key Rather than creating a new IEqualityComparer for the type can I simply specify the comparison inline using anonymous delegates lambda functions Something like var f1 f2 var f3 f1 Except f2 new IEqualityComparer Foo a Foo b a key CompareTo b key I m pretty sure the above doesn t actually work I just don t want to have to make something as heavy as a whole class just to tell the program how to compare apples to apples,csharp

We ve recently completed phase 1 of a ASP Net website in English and French We went with using resource files to store language specific strings but because the site used ASP Net AJAX and javascript heavily we rigged up a solution to pass the right files through the ASP Net pipeline where we could catch tokens and replace them with the appropriate text pulled from the resource files This is the second project I ve been involved in that had these kinds of challenges the first one stored the text strings in a database and instead of ASP Net AJAX it used the AJAX tools that come with the Prototype library and put all Javascript into aspx files so that the tokens could be replaced on the way out What I m wondering is has anyone else encountered a similar scenario What approach did you take What lessons were learned How did you deal with things like internationalized date formats,csharp

I am currently working on a website to track projects In it it is possible to create Service Level Agreements SLAs These are configurable with days of the week that a project can be worked on and also the timespan on each of those days Eg on Monday it might be between 08 00 and 16 00 and then on friday from 10 00 to 14 00 They are also configured with a deadline time depending on priority Eg a project created with the Low priority has a deadline time of two weeks and a project with High priority has a deadline of four hours The problem I m having is calculating the deadline AROUND the hours described earlier Say I create a project on Monday at 14 00 with a High priority That means I have four hours for this project But because of the working hours I have two hours on monday untill 16 00 and then another two hours on Friday That means the Deadline must be set for Friday at 12 00 I ve spent quite some time googling this and I can find quite a few examples of finding out how many working hours there are between a given start end ending date I just can t figure out how to convert it into FINDING the ending datetime given a starting time and an amount of time untill the deadline The day timespans are stored in an sql database in the format Day Eg 1 for Monday StartHour EndHour The StartHour EndHour are saved as DateTimes but of course only the time part is important The way I figure it is I have to somehow iterate through these times and do some datetime calculations I just can t quite figure out what those calculations should be what the best way is I found this Question here on the site as I was writing this It is sort of what I want and I m playing with it right now but I m still lost on how exactly to make it work around my dynamic work days hours,csharp

Summary I m developing a persistent Java web application and I need to make sure that all resources I persist have globally unique identifiers to prevent duplicates The Fine Print I m not using an RDBMS so I don t have any fancy sequence generators such as the one provided by Oracle I d like it to be fast preferably all in memory I d rather not have to open up a file and increment some value It needs to be thread safe I m anticipating that only one JVM at a time will need to generate IDs There needs to be consistency across instantiations of the JVM If the server shuts down and starts up the ID generator shouldn t re generate the same IDs it generated in previous instantiations or at least the chance has to be really really slim I anticipate many millions of presisted resources I have seen the examples in the EJB unique ID pattern article They won t work for me I d rather not rely solely on System currentTimeMillis because we ll be persisting multiple resources per millisecond I have looked at the answers proposed in this question My concern about them is what is the chance that I will get a duplicate ID over time I m intrigued by the suggestion to use java util UUID for a UUID but again the chances of a duplicate need to be infinitesimally small I m using JDK6,java

I ve recently created these two unrelated methods to replace lots of boiler plate code in my winforms application As far as I can tell they work ok but I need some reassurance advice on whether there are some problems I might be missing from memory static class SafeInvoker Utility to avoid boiler plate InvokeRequired code Usage SafeInvoker Invoke myCtrl gt myCtrl Enabled false public static void Invoke Control ctrl Action cmd if ctrl InvokeRequired ctrl BeginInvoke new MethodInvoker cmd else cmd Replaces OnMyEventRaised boiler plate code Usage SafeInvoker RaiseEvent this MyEventRaised public static void RaiseEvent object sender EventHandler evnt var handler evnt if handler null handler sender EventArgs Empty EDIT See related question here UPDATE Following on from deadlock problems related in this question I have switched from Invoke to BeginInvoke see an explanation here Another Update Regarding the second snippet I am increasingly inclined to use the empty delegate pattern which fixes this problem at source by declaring the event directly with an empty handler like so event EventHandler MyEventRaised delegate,csharp
I d like to have a custom object attached to the application so I can preserve state in it between different html pages in adobe air Is this possible I was asking for a fullblown solution to store a custom js object in memory and persist it between pages loaded from the application sandbox but this cannot be done unless I use iframes which is not very pleasant since I have to add a lot of stuff to the bridge Anoter way may be to do partial rendering of the page filled with html read from files but this exposes a lot of unpleasant bugs you cant write script tags in the dom dynamically It s a crippled platform,javascript

I m experimenting with internationalization by making a Hello World program that uses properties files ResourceBundle to get different strings Specifically I have a file messages_en_US properties that stores hello world Hello World which works fine of course I then have a file messages_ja_JP properties which I ve tried all sorts of things with but it always appears as some type of garbled string when printed to the console or in Swing The problem is obviously with the reading of the content into a Java string as a Java string in Japanese typed directly into the source can print fine Things I ve tried The properties file in UTF 8 encoding with the Japanese string as is for the value Something I read indicates that Java expects a properties file to be in the native encoding of the system It didn t work either way The file in default encoding ISO 8859 1 and the value stored as escaped Unicode created by the native2ascii program included with Java Tried with a source file in various Japanese encodings SHIFT JIS EUC JP ISO 2022 JP Edit I actually figured this out while I was typing this but I figured I d post it anyway and answer it in case it helps anyone,java

I ve just started using Java s enums in my own projects I have to use JDK 1 4 at work and I am confused as to the best practice of using JavaDoc for an enum I have found that this method works but the resultant code is a little unrefined Doc for enum public enum Something First thing FIRST_THING Second thing SECOND_THING could continue with more Is there any way I could break up the enum declarations on their own lines without chaining them by commas or is this the best approach for using JavaDoc for an enum,java

I need to create a slider for a client s site The slider should allow people to select how many items they want of x item and show what the price will be based on that The weird ish part is that the ratio of the price increase will go down as the amount of items goes up 1 item 100 2 items 90 190 3 items 80 270 4 items 70 340 5 items 60 400 6 items 50 450 7 items 50 500 And all increases from then on are 50 This probably seems like an overly simplistic question but does anyone know how I could go about doing this I have almost no experience with JavaScript,javascript

Nightly I need to fill a SQL Server 2005 table from an ODBC source with over 8 million records Currently I am using an insert statement from linked server with syntax select similar to this Insert Into SQLStagingTable from Select from OpenQuery ODBCSource Select from SourceTable This is really inefficient and takes hours to run I m in the middle of coding a solution using SqlBulkInsert code similar to the code found in this question The code in that question is first populating a datatable in memory and then passing that datatable to the SqlBulkInserts WriteToServer method What should I do if the populated datatable uses more memory than is available on the machine it is running a server with 16GB of memory in my case I ve thought about using the overloaded ODBCDataAdapter fill method which allows you to fill only the records from x to n where x is the start index and n is the number of records to fill However that could turn out to be an even slower solution than what I currently have since it would mean re running the select statement on the source a number of times What should I do Just populate the whole thing at once and let the OS manage the memory Should I populate it in chunks Is there another solution I haven t thought of,csharp
What s the best most efficient way to extract text set between parenthesis Say I wanted to get the string text from the string ignore everything except this text in the most efficient manner possible So far the best I ve come up with is this fullString ignore everything except this text start strpos fullString end strlen fullString strpos fullString shortString substr fullString start end Is there a better way to do this I know in general using regex tends to be less efficient but unless I can reduce the number of function calls perhaps this would be the best approach Thoughts,php

I m having performance oddities with Java2D I know of the sun java2d opengl VM parameter to enable 3D acceleration for 2D but even using that has some weird issues Here are results of tests I ran Drawing a 25x18 map with 32x32 pixel tiles on a JComponent Image 1 bmp format Image 2 A png format Without Dsun java2d opengl true 120 FPS using BMP image 1 13 FPS using PNG image 2 With Dsun java2d opengl true 12 FPS using BMP image 1 700 FPS using PNG image 2 Without acceleration I m assuming some kind of transformation is taking place with every drawImage I do in software and is pulling down the FPS considerably in the case of PNG Why though with acceleration would the results switch and PNG actually performs incredibly faster Craziness BMP Image 1 is translated to an image type of TYPE_INT_RGB PNG Image 2 is translated to an image type of TYPE_CUSTOM In order to get consistent speed with and without opengl acceleration I have to create a new BufferedImage with an image type of TYPE_INT_ARGB and draw Image 1 or Image 2 to this new image Here are the results running with that Without Dsun java2d opengl true 120 FPS using BMP image 1 120 FPS using PNG image 2 With Dsun java2d opengl true 700 FPS using BMP image 1 700 FPS using PNG image 2 My real question is can I assume that TYPE_INT_ARGB will be the native image type for all systems and platforms I m assuming this value could be different Is there some way for me to get the native value so that I can always create new BufferedImages for maximum performance Thanks in advance,java

I have a dict which I need to pass key values as keyword arguments For example d_args kw1 value1 kw2 value2 example d_args This works fine but if there are values in the d_args dict that are not accepted by the example function it obviously dies Say if the example function is defined as def example kw2 This is a problem since I don t control either the generation of the d_args or the example function They both come from external modules and example only accepts some of the keyword arguments from the dict Ideally I would just do parsed_kwargs feedparser parse the_url valid_kwargs get_valid_kwargs parsed_kwargs valid_for PyRSS2Gen RSS2 PyRSS2Gen RSS2 valid_kwargs I will probably just filter the dict from a list of valid keyword arguments but I was wondering Is there a way to programatically list the keyword arguments the a specific function takes,python

I have heard that WPF primitives will not be supported by remote desktop on windows XP The implication of this is that if you run a WPF application on a vista machine and display it on an XP machine via remote desktop the display will be sent as a compressed bitmap This issue is resolved in Vista Vista comunication via DirectX 11 but this will not be made available on XP There is obviously a performance hit here I would like to understand it before making any inroads into developing applications to WPF Some information on this topic can be found here http blogs msdn com tims archive 2007 01 05 comparing wpf on windows vista v windows xp aspx See comment from the above link quote To SpongeJim s question this is done by the MIL media integration layer which is the underlying core of WPF that handles composition On a Vista Vista remote desktop connection the MIL primitives are remoted and then reconstituted On other combinations e g 2003 XP what gets remoted is bitmaps which is obviously far more bandwidth intensive More depth on this topic can be found on Greg Schechter s blog and in this entry in particular http blogs msdn com greg_schechter archive 2006 06 09 623566 aspx Does anyone have any experience or more up to date information on this issue,csharp

Often times I find myself using std pair to define logical groupings of two related quantities as function arguments return values Some examples row col tag value etc Often times I should really be rolling my own class instead of just using std pair It s pretty easy to see when things start breaking down when the code becomes littered with make_pair first and second its very hard to remember what is what an std pair lt int int gt conveys less meaning than a type Position What have you found are the best ways to wrap the functionality of std pair in a type that conveys real meaning Here are some things I have considered typedef std pair lt int int gt Position This at least gives the type a meaningful name when passing it around but the type isn t enforced its still really just a pair and most of the same problems still exist This is however very simple to write struct Position public std pair lt int int gt typedef std pair lt int int gt Base Position Base Position const Position amp x Base x Position int a int b Base a b int amp row return first const int amp row const return first int amp col return second const int amp col const return second This is better since we can access the variables via a reasonably descriptive name The problem here is that you can still access first and second so its easy for the abstraction to leak Also accessing simple variables via functions makes the syntax annoying The obvious next step is to make the inheritance private struct Position private std pair lt int int gt typedef std pair lt int int gt Base Position Position const Position amp x Base x Position int a int b Base a b int amp row return first const int amp row const return first int amp col return second const int amp col const return second bool operator lt const Position amp x const return Base this lt Base x other forwarding operators as needed So now at least we have gotten rid of the access to first and second but now a new problem pops up When we want to store the type in an std set we now don t have access to the operator lt overload since we don t have access to first and second This means we have to define a forwarding function for each operator overload we want For me this is usually and lt but there could be others that I d want Yes I know I probably shouldn t overload operator lt just to stick it in an associative container but it makes everything so darn simple And defining these operators for each new type is a pain and we STILL have to access via functions We can fix that struct Position Position Position const Position amp x row x row col x col Position int row int col row row col col int row col bool operator lt const Position amp a const Position amp b return a row lt b row b row lt a row amp amp a col lt b col more overloads as needed So now we have simple variable access but now defining overloaded operators is even more of a pain because instead of just forwarding them to the pair s implementation we actually have to re implement them each time Are there any solutions I have overlooked that make this easy without the drawbacks If there aren t which would you tend to prefer,cpp

Say I have my sources in my src tree and possibly in my test tree Say I would like to compile only part of that tree The reasons why I might want to do that are various Just as an example I might want to create the smallest possible jar without including certain classes or I might want the fastest compile time for what I am compiling I absolutely want to compile all the dependencies though This can be easily achieved from the command line with javac d build cp whatever sourcepath src src path to MyClass java Now how can you do that with ant The javac ant task compiles everything The source and destination directory will be recursively scanned for Java source files to compile One can use the excludes and includes parameters but they are problematic for this purpose In fact it seems that one has to explicitly setup all the includes not automatic dependency lookup and even worst that excludes has priority on includes When both inclusion and exclusion are used only files directories that match at least one of the include patterns and don t match any of the exclude patterns are used Thus you cannot use lt javac srcdir src dir destdir build dir classpathref classpath excludes java includes src path to MyClass java gt Because it will not compile anything Is there any way of achieving that simple command line javac with ant EDITED Thank you for your answer Sadie I m accepting it because it does work in the way I was wondering in this question But I have a couple of comments too long to be in the comment field of your answer 1 I did read the documentation see links above but it s unclear that with just includes you are actually also excluding everything else 2 When you just includes ant logs something like javac Compiling 1 source file to my path to build even if the dependencies make it compiling much more than just one source file,java

I ve been wondering about how hard it would be to write some Python code to search a string for the index of a substring of the form expr for example where expr is meant to be a Python expression or something resembling one Given such a thing one could easily imagine going on to check the expression s syntax with compile evaluate it against a particular scope with eval and perhaps even substitute the result into the original string People must do very similar things all the time I could imagine solving such a problem using a third party parser generator oof or by hand coding some sort of state machine eek or perhaps by convincing Python s own parser to do the heavy lifting somehow hmm Maybe there s a third party templating library somewhere that can be made to do exactly this Maybe restricting the syntax of expr is likely to be a worthwhile compromise in terms of simplicity or execution time or cutting down on external dependencies for example maybe all I really need is something that matches any expr that has balanced curly braces What s your sense Update Thanks very much for your responses so far Looking back at what I wrote yesterday I m not sure I was sufficiently clear about what I m asking Template substitution is indeed an interesting problem and probably much more useful to many more people than the expression extraction subproblem I m wondering about but I brought it up only as a simple example of how the answer to my question might be useful in real life Some other potential applications might include passing the extracted expressions to a syntax highlighter passing the result to a real Python parser and looking at or monkeying with the parse tree or using the sequence of extracted expressions to build up a larger Python program perhaps in conjunction with some information taken from the surrounding text The expr syntax I mentioned is also intended as an example and in fact I wonder if I shouldn t have used expr as my example instead because it makes the potential drawbacks of the obvious approach along the lines of re finditer r s a bit easier to see Python expressions can and often do contain the or character It seems possible that handling any of those cases might be much more trouble than it s worth but I m not convinced of that yet Please feel free to try to make this case Prior to posting this question I spent quite a bit of time looking at Python template engines hoping that one might expose the sort of low level functionality I m asking about namely something that can find expressions in a variety of contexts and tell me where they are rather than being limited to finding expressions embedded using a single hard coded syntax always evaluating them and always substituting the results back into the original string I haven t figured out how to use any of them to solve my problem yet but I do very much appreciate the suggestions regarding more to look at can t believe I missed that wonderful list on the wiki The API documentation for these things tends to be pretty high level and I m not too familiar with the internals of any of them so I m sure I could use help looking at those and figuring out how to get them to do this sort of thing Thanks for your patience,python
One of the most difficult problems in my javascript experience has been the correct that is cross browser computing of a iframe height In my applications I have a lot of dynamically generated iframe and I want them all do a sort of autoresize at the end of the load event to adjust their height and width In the case of height computing my best solution is the following with the help of jQuery function getDocumentHeight doc var mdoc doc document if mdoc compatMode CSS1Compat return mdoc body offsetHeight else if browser msie return mdoc body scrollHeight else return Math max mdoc height mdoc body height I searched the internet without success I also tested Yahoo library that has some methods for document and viewport dimensions but it s not satisfactory My solution works decently but sometimes it calculates a taller height I ve studied and tested tons of properties regarding document height in Firefox IE Safari documentElement clientHeight documentElement offsetHeight documentElement scrollHeight body offsetHeight body scrollHeight Also jQuery doesn t have a coherent behavior in various browser with the calls document body height html doc height window height I call the above function not only at the end of load event but also in the case of dynamically inserted DOM elements or elements hidden or shown This is a case that sometimes breaks the code that works only in the load event Does someone have a real cross browser at least Firefox IE Safari solution Some tips or hints,javascript

I m trying to create a C class with a templated superclass The idea being I can easily create lots of similar subclasses from a number of superclasses which have similar characteristics I have distilled the problematic code as follows template_test h template lt class BaseClass gt class Templated public BaseClass public Templated int a virtual int Foo class Base protected Base int a public virtual int Foo 0 protected int b template_test cpp include template_test h Base Base int a b a 1 template lt class BaseClass gt Templated lt BaseClass gt Templated int a BaseClass a template lt class BaseClass gt int Templated lt BaseClass gt Foo return this gt b main cpp include template_test h int main Templated lt Base gt test 1 return test Foo When I build the code I get linker errors saying that the symbols Templated lt Base gt Templated int and Templated lt Base gt Foo cannot be found A quick Google suggests that adding the following to main cpp will solve the problem template lt gt Templated lt Base gt Templated int a template lt gt int Templated lt Base gt Foo But this does not solve the problem Adding the lines to main cpp does not work either Though interestingly adding them to both gives multiply defined symbol errors from the linker so they must be doing something However putting all the code in one source file does solve the problem While this would be ok for the noddy example above the real application I m looking at would become unmanageable very fast if I was forced to put the whole lot in one cpp file Does anyone know if what I m doing is even possible How can I solve my linker errors I would assume that I could make all the methods in class Templated inline and this would work but this doesn t seem ideal either,cpp

We are designing a Payroll Generation System for a client The organization we are targeting has a hierarchy as follows Company Cluster Business Unit BU Department Employee The salary for an employee is made up of various salary components Each salary component has 3 rules associated with it a Calculation Rule Calculate component as of another component or of a fixed number or a fixed number an Eligibility Rule whether an Employee Dept is eligible for a component and a Constraint Rule which limits tha max and min of a component These rules are editable and can be edited by a user end user Also these rules are inherited top down but if defined at a lower level the lower level rule takes precedence We have a database which has Attendance Leaves Bonuses tables and these rules are also supposed to interact with these tables The client will be generating payroll for multiple clients each hosting a Separate Database instance They may each have a different interpretation of each component and may have different components We are only looking to support SQL Server and payroll generation will be an offline activity We are divided upon where to put the logic which uses these rules to generate the individual tax components which will include Tax Deductions Tax Write offs Allowances etc Some people are advocating magic SPs which will take an employee Id and generate a payroll for that month Others want the logic to be split into separate components which will get the dependent data for an employee in the application layer and calculate these components there The order of our priorities are 1 The ability to adapt changes to new clients quickly 2 Long term maintainability 3 Performance 1 and 2 outweigh 3 here by a large factor as this will be an offline activity Maintainability and Quick Customizability are very important we will be deploying the application for different clients Client A may have a Salary Component Rule as 0 3 Basic 800 and Client B as 0 2 Basic 0 1 Atendance Bonus Will SPs cause a mess here as the rules suggested above will be specified by the end user and will need to be customizable through a web UI We will have to parse the formulas from SQL How difficult or easy will it be What advantage will doing this in the Application Layer C Net have over using SPs The original post is here http stackoverflow com questions 208707 design hints payroll systemrepost but none of the questions were properly answered Suggestions and pointers to existing systems architecture will be very helpful and yes we are using LINQ to SQL elsewhere in the system Kind regards Ashish Sharma,csharp

I have multiple threads C application running on IIS running that all need to communicate with the same MQ backend To minimize network traffic I need to only send a backend request when there is work to be done There will be one thread to monitor if there is work to be done and it needs to notify the other threads that they should also begin processing The current solution involves the monitor thread setting a global variable and having the other threads loop and check that ie in the monitor thread CheckIfWorkAvailable while true if queue Empty true workToBeDone true end while loop and then in the worker threads DoWork while true if workToBeDone true do work else Thread Sleep x seconds end while loop Can the monitor thread notify the worker threads when there is work to do instead of having them just loop and sleep The worker threads also set a counter indicating they are working and the decrement it when their work is done so the workToBeDone flag can be set to false,csharp

I understand that inline by itself is a suggestion to the compiler and at its descretion it may or may not inline the function and it will also produce linkable object code I think that static inline does the same may or may not inline but will not produce linkable object code when inlined since no other module could link to it Where does extern inline fit into the picture Assume I want to replace a preprocessor macro by an inline function and require that this function gets inlined e g because it uses the __FILE__ and __LINE__ macros which should resolve for the caller but not this called function That is I want to see a compiler or linker error in case the function does not get inlined Does extern inline do this I assume that if it does not there is no way to achieve this behavior other than sticking with a macro Are there differences between C and C Are there differences between different compiler vendors and versions,cpp

One of our providers are sometimes sending XML feeds that are tagged as UTF 8 encoded documents but includes characters that are not included in the UTF 8 charset This causes the parser to throw an exception and stop building the DOM object when these characters are encountered DocumentBuilder parse ByteArrayInputStream bais throws the following exception org xml sax SAXParseException Invalid byte 2 of 2 byte UTF 8 sequence Is there a way to capture these problems early and avoid the exception i e finding and removing those characters from the stream What I m looking for is a best effort type of fallback for wrongly encoded documents The correct solution would obviously be to attack the problem at the source and make sure that only correct documents are delivered but what is a good approach when that is not possible,java

Is there any good way to use a windows application written in C to display control a powerpoint slideshow Ultimately I would like to show thumbnails in a form and clicking these thumbnails would advance the slides shown on a second monitor similar to using Powerpoint itself to show a slideshow on a second monitor I would like to be able to use Powerpoint Viewer if Powerpoint is not installed There seems to be some ActiveX controls that allows integration of Powerpoint in a form but most of these seem to cost money does anyone have experience using one of these controls Edit I know that there is an object model accessable by adding a reference to Microsoft Office InterOp Powerpoint but I want to be able to distribute the resulting program without having Microsoft Office as a prerequisite that was why I mentioned Powerpoint Viewer because it can be distributed freely,csharp

Although elements like lt div gt s normally grow to fit their contents using the float property can cause a startling problem for CSS newbies if floated elements have non floated parent elements the parent will collapse For example lt div gt lt div style float left gt Div 1 lt div gt lt div style float left gt Div 2 lt div gt lt div gt The parent div in this example will not expand to contain its floated children it will appear to have height 0 How do you solve this problem I would like to create an exhaustive list of solutions here If you re aware of cross browser compatibility issues please point them out Solution 1 Float the parent lt div style float left gt lt div style float left gt Div 1 lt div gt lt div style float left gt Div 2 lt div gt lt div gt Pros Semantic code Cons You may not always want the parent floated Even if you do do you float the parents parent and so on Must you float every ancestor element Solution 2 Give the parent an explicit height lt div style height 300px gt lt div style float left gt Div 1 lt div gt lt div style float left gt Div 2 lt div gt lt div gt Pros Semantic code Cons Not flexible if the content changes or the browser is resized the layout will break Solution 3 Append a spacer element inside the parent element like this lt div gt lt div style float left gt Div 1 lt div gt lt div style float left gt Div 2 lt div gt lt div class spacer style clear both gt lt div gt lt div gt Pros Straightforward to code Cons Not semantic the spacer div exists only as a layout hack Solution 4 Set parent to overflow auto lt div style overflow auto gt lt div style float left gt Div 1 lt div gt lt div style float left gt Div 2 lt div gt lt div gt Pros Doesn t require extra div Cons Seems like a hack that s not the overflow property s stated purpose Comments Other suggestions,html
We ve had problems with a virus scanner murdering the performance of our app by slowing down writes to an H2 db So we d like to be able to detect the presence of any virus scanner and alert the user of the potential problem It would be part of a problem detection retue that would alert users to known performance factors specific to their systems The current suggestion is a write test that displays the warning if a disk write takes an unreasonable amount of time That does get to the actual problem but not to the cause So is there any reliable and direct way to detect virus protection one that doesn t rely on indirect effects We might end up doing both but it would be nice to be curtain in our suggestions,java

I ve recently inherited a fairly large web site The project is set up as a web site in Visual studio and not a Web Application For a number of reasons I would like to convert it to a web application I started converting the application using these directions from Scott Gu Migrating a VS 2005 Web Site Project to VS 2005 Web Application Project While doing the conversion I discovered that this web site uses a ton of include directives to include other aspx files The main problem with this is that currently each code behind file directly calls controls using this from the pages it is including This behavior seems to be allowed by the way that the compiler dynamically creates the designer files in memory at compile time The problem is that since I m converting the application to a Web Application I m creating physical versions of the designer files Now the same call to controls on the included pages using this no longer work I ve tried a few things to try and remedy this First I noticed that the aspx include files didn t have a Page directive so I tried adding one This prevented the app from compiling because the main page now had multiple page directives Second I tried to just rename the included aspx files to inc but I still have the same problem of the main page no longer being able to access the controls as they could before Anyone ever done this before and have any thoughts on how to proceed without changing the entire structure of the web site edit I decided not to go through with the conversion at this time simply because any benefits gained wouldn t be worth the trouble Thanks for the help,csharp

In Visual Studio I often use objects only for RAII purposes For example ScopeGuard close_guard MakeGuard amp close_file file The whole purpose of close_guard is to make sure that the file will be close on function exit it is not used anywhere else However Visual Studio gives me a warning that a local variable is initialized but not referenced I want to turn this warning off for this specific case How do you deal with this kind of situation Visual Studio thinks that this object is useless but this is wrong since it has a non trivial destructor I wouldn t want to use a pragma warning directive for this since it would turn off this warning even for legitimate reasons,cpp

I don t understand why does the following regular expression Match the string 127 0 0 1 Using Regex IsMatch 127 0 0 1 Using Expresso it does not match which is also what I would expect Using the expression does match the string which I would also expect Technically should match the beginning of a string line any number of times followed by the ending of the string line It seems is implicitly treated as a What am I missing EDIT Run the following to see an example of the problem using System using System Text RegularExpressions namespace RegexFubar class Program static void Main string args Console WriteLine Regex IsMatch 127 0 0 1 Console Read I do not wish to have match my string I am wondering why it does match it I would think that the expression should result in an exception being thrown or at least a non match EDIT2 To clear up any confusion I did not write this regex with the intention of having it match 127 0 0 1 A user of our application entered the expression and wondered why it matched the string when it should not After looking at it I could not come up with an explanation for why it matched especially not since Expresso and NET seems to handle it differently I guess the question is answered by it being due to the NET implementation avoiding throwing an exception even thought it s technically an incorrect expression But is this really what we want,csharp
Scenario If anyone has answered viewed my questions recently this will be somewhat familar I have 3 different web services which expose a set of objects that have commonality I ve written wrapper classes and conversion logic using generic methods to change between the intermediary objects and the service object I have an interface for the Webservice let it be called IService for the purpose of this question I have 3 implementation classes Service1Impl Service2Impl and Service3Impl Each of these referencing a different web service and using my aforementioned generic methods to convert between the appropriate objects These are injected into my ServiceWrapper class at runtime via the constructor a factory is used to create the appopriate implementation of the ISerivice e g _service ServiceWrapper GetServiceWrapper 2 Will give me a ServiceWrapper instantiated with the Service2Impl Dammit diagrams would be hella useful Ok so each implementation of IService has a method called for arguments sake GetProperties public IProperty GetProperties string item IProperty properties Property props ServiceObjectFactory CreateProperties lt Property gt properties Property result _service GetProperties item props return ServiceObjectFactory CreateProperties result This looks a little confusing I think I m going to refactor the names Basically what is happening is The call to this function from ServiceWrapper is made with the intermediary objects IProperty as you can see from the parameters The intermediary objects are converted to Property objects which are service specific The result comes back as service specific Property objects The result is converted to the intermediary objects before being passed back to the ServiceWrapper Now this code is going to be exactly the same for Service1Impl Service2Impl and Service3Impl Except of course that the types used are different Can anyone think of a way to do this so that I don t have the same code 3 times N B This is not true of every method in each Implementation Just most of them,csharp

This article describes a way in C to allow the addition of arbitrary value types which have a operator defined for them In essence it allows the following code public T Add T val1 T val2 return val1 val2 This code does not compile as there is no guarantee that the T type has a definition for the operator but the effect is achieved with code like this public T Add T val1 T val2 Num lt T gt defines a operation which returns a value of type T return new Num lt T gt val1 new Num lt T gt val2 Follow the link to see how the Num class achieves this Anyways on to the question Is there any way to achieve the same effect in C or C For the curious the problem I m trying to solve is to allow a CUDA kernel to be more flexible general by allowing it to operate on more types Update For NET Marc Gravell has made a utility library which solves the operator problem very elegantly,cpp

I m in the process of making my PHP site Unicode aware I m wondering if anyone has experience with the mbstring func_overload setting which replaces the normal string functions e g strlen with their multi byte equivalents mb_strlen There aren t any comments on the PHP manual page Are there any potential problems that I should be aware of Any cases where calling the multi byte version is a bad idea I suppose one example would be functions that deal with encryption since they may expect to deal with strings of bytes rather than strings of characters Also the manual page includes a note It is not recommended to use the function overloading option in the per directory context because it s not confirmed yet to be stable enough in a production environment and may lead to undefined behaviour Does that mean that it s not stable in a per directory context or it s generally not stable The wording is unclear,php

Simple question that keeps bugging me Should I HTML encode user input right away and store the encoded contents in the database or should I store the raw values and HTML encode when displaying Storing encoded data greatly reduces the risk of a developer forgetting to encode the data when it s being displayed However storing the encoded data will make datamining somewhat more cumbersome and it will take up a bit more space even though that s usually a non issue,html

I have a class that I need to binary serialize The class contains one field as below private T m_data These multi dimensional arrays can be fairly large hundreds of thousands of elements and of any primitive type When I tried standard net serialization on an object the file written to disk was large and I think net is storing a lot of repeated data about element types and possibly not as efficiently as could be done I have looked around for custom serializers but have not seen any that deal with multi dimensional generic arrays I have also experimented with built in net compression on a byte array of the memory stream following serializing with some success but not as quick compressed as I had hoped My question is should I try and write a custom serializer to optimally serialize this array for the appropriate type this seems a little daunting or should I use standard net serialization and add compression Any advice on the best approach would be most appreciated or links to resources showing how to tackle serialization of a multi dimensional generic array as mentioned existing examples I have found do not support such structures,csharp
open_basedir limits the files that can be opened by PHP within a directory tree I am storing several class libraries and configuration files outside of my web root directory This way the web server does not make them publicly accessible However when I try to include them from my application I get an open_basedir restriction error like this Warning realpath function realpath open_basedir restriction in effect File var www vhosts domain tld zend application is not within the allowed path s var www vhosts domain tld httpdocs tmp in var www vhosts domain tld httpdocs index php on line 5 My web root is here var www vhosts domain tld httpdocs My libraries and configuration directory are here var www vhosts domain tld zend What would be the best workaround to relax the open_basedir restriction so that the the directory tree under the domain folder becomes available to my application I have a number of domains that I want to do this with and I m also obviously wary of creating security vulnerabilities Note I am using CentOS Apache Plesk and I have root ssh access to the server And though this doesn t apply to Zend Framework directly I am using it in this instance So here is the inclusion from Zend s bootstrap define APPLICATION_PATH realpath dirname __FILE__ zend application set_include_path APPLICATION_PATH zend library PATH_SEPARATOR get_include_path,php
Ruby on Rails has a lot of ways to generate JavaScript Particularly when it comes to Ajax Unfortunately there are a few problems that I often see with the JavaScript that it generates Rails typically uses inline event handling lt a onclick somejavascript return false gt This is generally frowned upon as it s mixing behavior in with the XHTML The generated JavaScript also relies heavily on Prototype Personally I prefer jQuery In my experience the attitude with a lot of Rails developers has been to write as much of the code in Ruby as possible The final step being to generate some very procedural and repetitive JavaScript Often this code ends up being very inflexible and difficult to debug So my question is how much JavaScript do you write manually for your projects and how much of it is generated server side with Rails Ruby Or is there a happy medium where you get the benefits of both With a subquestion if you write a lot of the JavaScript manually what techniques do you use to fit it into the MVC model,javascript

I have always found this to be a very useful feature in Visual Studio For those who don t know about it it allows you to edit code while you are debugging a running process re compile the code while the binary is still running and continue using the application seamlessly with the new code without the need to restart it How is this feature implemented If the code I am modifying is in a DLL loaded by the application does the application simply unload the DLL and reload it again This would seem to me like it would be prone to instability issues so I assume it would be smarter than this Any ideas,cpp

I keep hearing people complaining that C doesn t have garbage collection I also hear that the C Standards Committee is looking at adding it to the language I m afraid I just don t see the point to it using RAII with smart pointers eliminates the need for it right My only experience with garbage collection was on a couple of cheap eighties home computers where it meant that the system would freeze up for a few seconds every so often I m sure it has improved since then but as you can guess that didn t leave me with a high opinion of it What advantages could garbage collection offer an experienced C developer,cpp

So my group is trying to set up a shared server environment for various and sundry web services I think we ve settled on setting disable_functions and disable_classes site wide in php ini and php_admin_value to force open_basedir in each app s httpd conf for php scripts and passenger s user switching for ruby scripts We still need to find something for python though Passenger does support python but not for per application security for specific sub directories it s all or nothing at the domain level Any suggestions And if any of the previous doesn t make sense well I m the guy who s supposed to set up the python support not the guy who set up the php or ruby support so there s still some and then some magic happens steps in there from my perspective,php

Recently I made a post about the developers I m working with not using try catch blocks properly and unfortuantely using try catch blocks in critical situations and ignoring the exception error all together causing me major heart ache Here is an example of one of the several thousand sections of code that they did this some code left out that doesn t particuarly matter public void AddLocations BOLocation objBllLocations try dbManager Open if objBllLocations StateID 0 about 20 Paramters added to dbManager here else about 19 Paramters added here dbManager ExecuteNonQuery CommandType StoredProcedure ULOCATIONS AddLocations catch Exception ex finally dbManager Dispose This is absolutely discusting in my eyes and does not notify the user in case some potential problem occurred I know many people say that OOP is evil and that adding multiple layers adds to the number of lines of code and to the complexity of the program leading to possible issues with code maintainence Much of my programming background I personally have taken almost the same approach in this area Below I have listed out a basic structure of the way I normally code in such a situation and I ve been doing this accross many languages in my career but this particular code is in C But the code below is a good basic idea of how I use the Objects it seems to work for me but since this is a good source of some fairly inteligent programming mines I d like to know If I should re evaluate this technique that I ve used for so many years Mainly because in the next few weeks i m going to be plunging into the not so good code from the outsourced developers and modifying huge sections of code i d like to do it as well as possible sorry for the long code reference lt summary gt Summary description for

advice here,csharp

Today I had a discussion with a colleague about nested functions in Javascript function a function b alert boo var c Bound to local call object d Bound to global object In this example trials point out that b is not reachable outside the body of a much like c is However d is after executing a Looking for the exact definition of this behaviour in the ECMAScript v 3 standard I didn t find the exact wording I was looking for what Sec 13 p 71 does not say is which object the function object created by the function declaration statement is to be bound to Am I missing something,javascript

I ve seen with Microsoft COM and XPCOM at least from what I ve read and gathered so far that the implementations of interfaces in a component have to essentially be in the single class that derives all the virtual interfaces Is this correct What am I missing Is there a way to have multiple objects possibly in separate DLL s each provide their functionality and still be able to freely transition between them using QueryIterface What I m looking for is to have a component with some functionality but still allow external client code to create new extensions of the component with possibly new interfaces Ideally this should happen without divulging the current source of the component and its implementation,cpp

I was re reading Effective Java 2nd edition item 18 prefer interfaces to abstract classes In that item Josh Bloch provides an example of a skeletal implementation of the Map Entry lt K V gt interface Skeletal Implementation public abstract class AbstractMapEntry lt K V gt implements Map Entry lt K V gt Primitive operations public abstract K getKey public abstract V getValue remainder omitted Two questions stem from this example Why are getKey and getValue explicitly declared here as abstract methods They are part of the Map Entry interface so I don t see a reason for the redundant declaration in the abstract class Why use the idiom of leaving these primitives methods as Mr Bloch refers to them as abstract Why not just do this Skeletal Implementation public abstract class AbstractMapEntry implements Map Entry private K key private V value Primitive operations public K getKey return key public V getValue return value remainder omitted The benefits of this are that each subclass doesn t have to define its own set of fields and can still access the key and value by their accessors If a subclass truly needs to define its own behavior for the accessors it can implement the Map Entry interface directly The other downside is that in the equals method provided by the skeletal implementation the abstract accessors are called Implements the general contract of Map Entry equals Override public boolean equals Object o if o this return true if o instanceof Map Entry return false Map Entry lt gt arg Map Entry o return equals getKey arg getKey amp amp equals getValue arg getValue Bloch warns against calling overridable methods item 17 from classes designed for inheritance as it leaves the superclass vulnerable to changes made by subclasses Maybe this is a matter of opinion but I was hoping to determine whether there s more to the story as Bloch doesn t really elaborate on this in the book,java

In some code I ve inherited I see frequent use of size_t with the std namespace qualifier For example std size_t n sizeof long It compiles and runs fine of course But it seems like bad practice to me perhaps carried over from C Isn t it true that size_t is built into C and therefore in the global namespace Is a header file include needed to use size_t in C Another way to ask this question is would the following program with no includes be expected to compile on all C compilers size_t foo return sizeof long,cpp

I have a C collection of strings Each string is a sentence that can appear on a page I also have a collection of page breaks which is a collection of int s representing the index where the collection of strings are split to a new page Example Each 10 items in the string collection is a page so the collection of page breaks would be a collection of int s with the values of 10 20 30 So if there are 2 pages of strings then there will be 1 item in the page break collection and if there is 1 page then the page break collection would have zero items I am trying to create the following function List lt string gt GetPage List lt string gt docList List lt int gt pageBreakList int pageNum This function returns a subset of docList just the page requested I ve taken a few stabs at writing this function and keep on coming up with complex if and switch statements to take into account single and two page documents and page numbers being requested outside the range e g last page should be returned if page number is greater than number of pages and first page if page number is 0 or less My struggle with this problem leads me to ask the question Is there a well known pattern or algorithm to address this type of subset query,csharp

When you attempt to declare an unsigned variable in C NET with a value outside its value range it is flagged as a compiler error but if you produce a negative value at runtime and assign it to that variable at runtime the value wraps uint z 1 Will not compile uint a 5 uint b 6 uint c a b Will result in uint MaxValue Is there a good reason why unsigned variables wrap in such a situation instead of throwing an exception Thanks,csharp

I have the requirement of generating UML Diagrams for one of my C assignments I m using Visio 2007 and I m having trouble representing C pointers I ve found a way to add a suffix to Datatypes however it s rather time consuming to do this for every pointer used or returned in my program Basically I m trying to get object1 Object NULL and Object Object without digging into the properties and adding to the suffix field every time I m pretty much stuck with Microsoft software for making diagrams and coding so please don t suggest I use different software However if Visual Studio 2003 supports making UML Diagrams in a less painful way than Visio I wouldn t object to using Visual Studio but please tell me where that option is,cpp

I have a third party product a terminal emulator which provides a DLL that can be linked to a C program to basically automate the driving of this product send keystrokes detect what s on the screen and so forth I want to drive it from a scripting language I m comfortable with Python and slightly less so with Perl so that we don t have to compile and send out executables to our customers whenever there s a problem found We also want the customers to be able to write their own scripts using ours as baselines and they won t entertain the idea of writing and compiling C code What s a good way of getting Python Perl to interface to a Windows DLL My first thought was to write a server program and have a Python script communicate with it via TCP but there s got to be an easier solution,python
I m currently working on a project which needs to persist any kind of object of which implementation we don t have any control so these objects could be recovered afterwards We can t implement an ORM because we can t restrict the users of our library at development time Our first alternative was to serialize it with the Java default serialization but we had a lot of trouble recovering the objects when the users started to pass different versions of the same object attributes changed types names We have tried with the XMLEncoder class transforms an object into a XML but we have found that there is a lack of functionality doesn t support Enums for example Finally we also tried JAXB but this impose our users to annotate their classes Any good alternative,java

Is there explicit support for Single Table Inheritance in Django Last I heard the feature was still under development and debate Are there libraries hacks I can use in the meantime to capture the basic behavior I have a hierarchy that mixes different objects The canonical example of a corporation structure with an Employee class subclasses for types of employees and a manager_id parent_id would be a good approximation of the problem I am solving In my case I would like to represent the idea that an employee can manage other employees while being managed by a different employee There are not separate classes for Manager and Worker which makes this hard to spread across tables Sub classes would represent types of employees programmers accountants sales etc and would be independent of who supervises who OK I guess it s no longer a typical corporation in some respect,python
I am designing a simple internal framework for handling time series data Given that LINQ is my current toy hammer I want to hit everything with it I want to implement methods in class TimeSeries Select Where and so on so that I can use LINQ syntax to handle time series data Some things are straight forward e g from x in A select x 10 giving a new time series What is the best syntax design for combining two or more time series from a in A from b in B select a b is not great since it expresses a nested loop Maybe some join This should correspond to join on the implicit time variable What I have in mind corresponds to the lisp zip function EDIT Some clarification is necessary A time series is a kind of function depending on time e g stock quotes A combination of time series could be the difference between two stock prices as a function of time Stock1 MyJoin Stock2 a b gt a b is possible but can this be expressed neatly using some LINQ syntax I am expecting to implement LINQ methods in class MyTimeSeries myself,csharp

We use a base entity with properties such as version datetime needed for NHibernate and guid as key It also has an Id int field with two functions Firstly to relate to legacy application key if there is one Secondly as a shorthand code for instance files are sometimes created based on these which would look ugly and long using our guid key My question is not really about pros and cons of base entities but about up typing this Id to Int64 It would not affect how it is stored within our MS SQL Server database Would it have more cost in our cache and memory Is this really that much of a worry I am interested to hear other downsides besides performance Consider also these values will probably be exposed through web services to third parties in time too The alternative is to deal with the exceptions of larger integers as they arise and implement them specifically in derived entities The downside is this would need to be done in code and what would we do when we discover some cases when in production of larger integers There would of course be input validation to stop actual errors but it may restrict expanding data,csharp

As you know in ASP NET you can store session data in one of following three modes InProc Session State SQL Server For InProc mode you can store any kind of data objects even it s not serializable However in Session State and SQL Server modes you can only store serialized data In my project I have a ready made portal which use InProc mode to store its session I need to use Session State instead due to some scalability and failure handling issues The problem that this portal is internally storing unserialized objects in the session context i e The stored objects doesn t implement ISerializable interface I have no access to their code Is there any work around so that I can be able to store the session objects in State Server without changing their code I still have access to their web config file if this would help in any kind,csharp
I ll try to explain my scenario as best i can At each application tick I query the current state of the keyboard and mouse and wrap them in individual classes and data structures For the keyboard it s an array of my Keys enum one item for each of the keys that are currently pressed and for the mouse it s a class containing coordinate delta s and bools for each buttons pressed I also have a rudimentary state machine managed via a state manager class which maintains the stack and marshalls the states All I want to know is how best to pass the input snapshots to the individual states my app can be in at any one time I would like to process as much of the input as possible away from the individual states so as to reduce repeating logic within the states Or would it be better to keep the input snapshots as pure as possible and pass them to the states so they can keep they re input specific logic hidden Note This structure is similiar to how I imagine a game would work and although this application is not a game it does need to be processed as quickly as possible,csharp

The Situation I have an area of the screen that can be shown and hidden via JavaScript something like show hide advanced search options Inside this area there are form elements select checkbox etc For users using assistive technology like a screen reader in this case JAWS we need to link these form elements with a label or use the title attribute to describe the purpose of each element I m using the title attribute because there isn t enough space for a label and the tooltip you get is nice for non screen reader users The code looks something like this lt div id placeholder style display none gt lt select title Month gt lt option gt January lt option gt lt option gt February lt option gt lt select gt lt div gt The Problem Normally JAWS will not read hidden elements because well they re hidden and it knows that However it seems as though if the element has a title set JAWS reads it no matter what If I remove the title JAWS reads nothing but obviously this is in accessible markup Possible Solutions My first thought was to use a hidden label instead of the title like this lt div id placeholder style display none gt lt label for month style display none gt Month lt label gt lt select id month gt lt select gt lt div gt This results in the exact same behavior and now we lose the tool tips for non screen reader users Also we end up generating twice as much Html The second option is to still use a label put position it off the screen That way it will be read by the screen reader but won t be seen by the visual user lt div id placeholder style display none gt lt label for month style position absolute left 5000px width 1px gt Month lt label gt lt select id month gt lt select gt lt div gt This actually works but again we lose the tool tip and still generate additional Html My third possible solution is to recursively travel through the DOM in JavaScript removing the title when the area is hidden and adding it back when the area is shown This also works but is pretty ugly for obvious reasons and doesn t really scale well to a more general case Any other ideas anyone Why is JAWS behaving this way,javascript

For example when I m dividing two ints and want a float returned I superstitiously write something like this int a 2 b 3 float c float a float b If I do not cast a and b to floats it ll do integer division and return an int Similarly if I want to multiply a signed 8 bit number with an unsigned 8 bit number I will cast them to signed 16 bit numbers before multiplying for fear of overflow u8 a 255 s8 b 127 s16 s16 a s16 b How exactly does the compiler behave in these situations when not casting at all or when only casting one of the variables Do I really need to explicitly cast all of the variables or just the one on the left or the one on the right,cpp

What is the best way of working with calculated fields of Propel objects Say I have an object Customer that has a corresponding table customers and each column corresponds to an attribute of my object What I would like to do is add a calculated attribute Number of completed orders to my object when using it on View A but not on Views B and C The calculated attribute is a COUNT of Order objects linked to my Customer object via ID What I can do now is to first select all Customer objects then iteratively count Orders for all of them but I d think doing it in a single query would improve performance But I cannot properly hydrate my Propel object since it does not contain the definition of the calculated field s How would you approach it,php

I m having a problem creating a fixed size overall panel for a touchscreen GUI application that has to take up the entire screen In a nutshell the touchscreen is 800 x 600 pixels and therefore I want the main GUI panel to be that size When I start a new GUI project in NetBeans I set the properties of the main panel for min max preferred size to 800 x 600 and the panel within the Design view changes size However when I launch the app it is resized to the original default size Adding this code after initComponents does not help this mainPanel setSize new Dimension 800 600 this mainPanel setMaximumSize new Dimension 800 600 this mainPanel setMinimumSize new Dimension 800 600 this mainPanel repaint I ve peeked into all of the resource files and cannot seem to find values that would override these which seems somewhat impossible anyway given that I m setting them after initComponents does its work I m using the FreeDesign layout because I wanted complete control over where I put things I suspect the layout manager is resizing things based upon how many widgets I have on the screen because different prototyped screens come in at differing sizes Help is appreciated,java
I m developing an application that manages network interfaces on behalf of the user and it calls out to several external programs such as ifconfig that requires root to make changes Specifically changing the IP address of a local interface etc During development I have been running the IDE as root ugh and the debugger as root double ugh Is there a nice way for the end user to run these under a non root account I strongly dislike the size of the attack surface presented by GTK wxPython Python and my application when it runs as root I have looked into capabilities but they look half baked and I m not sure if I d be able to use them in Python especially if they are on a thread basis The only option I haven t explored is a daemon that has the setuid bit set and does all the root type stuff on behalf of the UI I m hesitant to introduce that complexity this early in the project as running as root is not a dealbreaker for the users,python
Recently I wrote a function to generate certain sequences with nontrivial constraints The problem came with a natural recursive solution Now it happens that even for relatively small input the sequences are several thousands thus I would prefer to use my algorithm as a generator instead of using it to fill a list with all the sequences Here is an example Suppose we want to compute all the permutations of a string with a recursive function The following naive algorithm takes an extra argument storage and appends a permutation to it whenever it finds one def getPermutations string storage prefix if len string 1 storage append prefix string lt else for i in range len string getPermutations string i string i 1 storage prefix string i storage getPermutations abcd storage for permutation in storage print permutation Please don t care about inefficiency this is only an example Now I want to turn my function into a generator i e to yield a permutation instead of appending it to the storage list def getPermutations string prefix if len string 1 yield prefix string lt else for i in range len string getPermutations string i string i 1 prefix string i for permutation in getPermutations abcd print permutation This code does not work the function behaves like an empty generator Am I missing something Is there a way to turn the above recursive algorithm into a generator without replacing it with an iterative one,python
I have a Django model with a large number of fields and 20000 table rows To facilitate human readable URLs and the ability to break down the large list into arbitrary sublists I would like to have a URL that looks like this browse lt name1 gt lt value1 gt lt name2 gt lt value2 gt etc where name maps to a model attribute and value is the search criteria for that attribute Each name will be treated like a category to return subsets of the model instances where the categories match Now this could be handled with GET parameters but I prefer more readable URLs for both the user s sake and the search engines These URLs subsets will be embedded on each page that displays this model so it seems worth the effort to make pretty URLs Ideally each name value pair will be passed to the view function as a parameter named name1 name2 etc However I don t believe it s possible to defined named patterns via a regex s matched text Am I wrong there So it seems I need to do something like this urlpatterns patterns url r browse w w app views view name model_browse It seems this should match any sets of two name value pairs While it matches it successfully it only passes the last name value pair as parameters to the view function My guess is that each match is overwriting the previous match Under the guess that the containing is causing it I tried a simple repeating pattern instead urlpatterns patterns url r browse w app views view name model_browse and got the same problem but this time args only includes the last matched pattern Is this a limitation of Django s url dispatcher and or Python s regex support It seems either of these methods should work Is there a way to achieve this without hardcoding each possible model attribute in the URL as an optional pattern,python
I m writing a utility in Python that will attach changed files in Subversion to an email and send it when a subset of folders that are under source control in SVN have been changed I am using the pysvn library to access the repository I have a copy of the files on my local file system and I do an update to check if the files have changed since the last time the utility was run I am at the point where I am translating the path names in SVN to the path names on my local copy Currently I have written the following to do the job def formatPaths self paths newPaths list for path in paths path path len self basePath path path replace newPaths append path return newPaths self basePath would be something like trunk project1 and I m looking to just get the relative path of a subset of folders I e folder1 under trunk project1 Is this a good way to solve this problem or is there some magical function I missed,python

OK I have a somewhat complicated system in C In a nutshell I need to add a method to a third party abstract base class The third party also provides a ton of derived classes that also need the new functionality I m using a library that provides a standard Shape interface as well as some common shapes class Shape public Shape position virtual Shape virtual position GetPosition const virtual void SetPosition position virtual double GetPerimeter const 0 private class Square public Shape public Square position side_length class Circle Rectangle Hexagon etc Now here s my problem I want the Shape class to also include a GetArea function So it seems like I should just do a class ImprovedShape public virtual Shape virtual double GetArea const 0 class ImprovedSquare public Square public ImprovedShape And then I go and make an ImprovedSquare that inherits from ImprovedShape and Square Well as you can see I have now created the dreaded diamond inheritance problem This would easily be fixed if the third party library used virtual inheritance for their Square Circle etc However getting them to do that isn t a reasonable option So what do you do when you need to add a little functionality to an interface defined in a library Is there a good answer Thanks,cpp

I am working in Java on a fairly large project My question is about how to best structure the set of Properties for my application Approach 1 Have some static Properties object that s accessible by every class Disadvantages then some classes lose their generality should they be taken out of the context of the application they also require explicit calls to some static object that is located in a different class and may in the future disappear it just doesn t feel right am I wrong Approach 2 Have the Properties be instantiated by the main class and handed down to the other application classes Disadvantages you end up passing a pointer to the Properties object to almost every class and it seems to become very redundant and cumbersome I don t like it Any suggestions,java

I ve got a little c windows service that periodically pulls xml from a web service and stores the data in a database table Unfortunately it s failing because the web service has occasional bad data in it strings instead of decimals I don t have any control over the web service unvalidated user input from software we can t change but I would like to log the bad data so that it can be re input It s simple data that looks something like this lt ROWS gt lt ROW gt lt COL1 gt 5405 lt COL1 gt lt COL2 gt 102 24 lt COL1 gt lt ROW gt lt ROW gt lt COL1 gt 5406 lt COL1 gt lt COL2 gt 2 25 lt COL1 gt lt ROW gt lt ROWS gt The table just has two columns COL1 NUMBER 10 COL2 NUMBER 10 2 I was using a validating XmlReader and this XSD lt xml version 1 0 encoding utf 8 gt lt xs schema id ROWS xmlns xmlns xs http www w3 org 2001 XMLSchema xmlns msdata urn schemas microsoft com xml msdata gt lt xs element name ROWS msdata IsDataSet true msdata Locale en US gt lt xs complexType gt lt xs choice minOccurs 0 maxOccurs unbounded gt lt xs element name ROW gt lt xs complexType gt lt xs sequence gt lt xs element name COL1 type xs decimal minOccurs 0 gt lt xs element name COL2 type xs decimal minOccurs 0 gt lt xs sequence gt lt xs complexType gt lt xs element gt lt xs choice gt lt xs complexType gt lt xs element gt lt xs schema gt then a dataset ReadXml and Update ing the dataset Whenever it hits bad data I get the following exception System Xml Schema XmlSchemaValidationException was unhandled Message The COL1 element is invalid The value A40 is invalid according to its datatype http www w3 org 2001 XMLSchema decimal The string A40 is not a valid Decimal value I can think of several ways of ways of getting around the problem but they all feel like a bit of a kludge and I d like to learn something more elegant and improve my knowledge Here s what I ve come up with so far Pre process the XML provided by the web service before loading into the validating XML reader removing any bad nodes entirely Catch the XmlSchemaValidationExceptions and try to continue from them gracefully not sure about that one Don t use a validating XML reader but instead catch exceptions when loading the unvalidated xml into the dataset again not sure about that have string columns in the dataset and ignore bad data until I update it and catch anything the database rejects go and stand over the users with a large mallet until they learn to get it right first time too time consuming something else UPDATE The data can be bad because it comes from a application that doesn t validate the user input for COL1 but the numbers in COL2 are calculated correctly and COL1 should correspond with a different system Any invalid entries should be recorded so they can be corrected After the data is written to the database another system verifies that COL1 is valid and the users will soon spot if it doesn t show correctly in the other system they used to load it by hand anyway,csharp

Basically I have an iframe embedded in a page and the iframe has some JavaScript routines I need to invoke from the parent page Now the opposite is quite simple as you only need to call parent functionName but unfortunately I need exactly the opposite of that Please note that my problem is not changing the source URL of the iframe but invoking a function defined in the iframe,javascript

We ve had an ongoing need here that I can t figure out how to address using the stock Maven 2 tools and documentation Some of our developers have some very long running JUnit tests usually stress tests that under no circumstances should be run as a regular part of the build process nightly build Of course we can use the surefire plugin s exclusion mechanism and just punt them from the build but ideally we d love something that would allow the developer to run them at will through Maven 2,java

We are developing a small in house application that will run on monitor having multi resolutions Now we want that the application should adjust itself and remain consistent over all monitors I came from a Java background too where we used different layouts to accomplish the task I experimented in NET with different layouts like UniGrid which provide the consistency but very restrictive Grid etc but failed in the required task What are some possible layout model or some other solution I think if we can specify percentage width or height as we do in CSS HTML then we can adopt this cross resolution policy I found Infergistics have such controls but can this can be achieved via default controls P S I am actually trying in WPF preferably WPF native application,csharp

I have a problem with a simple included file The file being included is in two MFC programs one of which is a dll and it also compiles itself into a non mfc dll Recently I was using the larger dll which wraps around the source of the smaller dll when I wanted access to some of the features of the original code that isn t exposed by the larger dll Since this was a test I simply added the source to my project and called the functions I got this error syntax error missing before The file is correctly included and I have both the cpp and the h in the source folder and within the project but it wouldn t compile I eventually created a very small test project main cpp spooler cpp and spooler h the spooler is a wrapper around the comms and tried to compile that Same issue So I ripped out all the dll related stuff just in case there is a weird issue going on with that and it still won t compile I can t think of the life of me what is wrong Does anyone else have any ideas p s Jeff you really need to add the ability to attach files because the source would fill up too many screens with data,cpp

I am using the WMD markdown editor in a project for a large number of fields that correspond to a large number of properties in a large number of Entity classes Some classes may have multiple properties that require the markdown I am storing the markdown itself since this makes it easier to edit the fields later However I need to convert the properties to HTML for display later on The question is is there some pattern that I can use to avoid writing markdown conversion code in all my entity classes I created a utility class with a method that accepts a markdown string and returns the HTML I am using markdownj and this works fine The problem is for each property of each class that stores markdown I may need another method that converts to HTML public class Course private String description public String getDescription return description public String getDescriptionAsHTML return MarkdownUtil convert getDescription The problem there is that if the Course class has 2 more properties Tuition and Prerequisites say that both need converters then I will have to write getTuitionAsHTML and getPrerequisiteAsHTML I find that a bit ugly and would like a cleaner solution The classes that require this are not part of a single inheritance hierarchy The other option I am considering is doing this in the controller rather than the model What are your thoughts on this Thanks EDIT New thoughts Thanks Jasper Since the project uses struts2 I did not say this before I could create a view component say that will convert the markdown for me Then I use that wherever I need to display the value as HTML,java

I ve been looking for a good PHP ORM tool to use and I recently found a good ORM class in Kohana It has a fairly good and simple ORM implementation The problem is the code is unreusable outside of the Kohana framework without a rewrite refactor It relies on the Kohana class loader and various framework loading strategies to even work in the first place Further the required classes aren t packaged into a single dependency directory or even multiple directories When I do this rewrite I intend to republish the code via sourceforge or something and those guys can of course reuse it if they want So should I just package the fileset needed into one directory and make the appropriate classes do a require_once on any dependant classes and 2 should I stick with the original class names that are project dependent like Kohana_exception even though it is pretty much unrelated to the Kohana project as a whole A second option would be to write another classloader that is a simplified version of the Kohana Framework classloader and only cares about the ORM related stuff,php

I have put together a script which is very much like the flickr photostream feature Two thumbnails next to each other and when you click the next or prev links the next or previous two images slide in Cool Currently when the page loads it loads the two images The first time nxt prv is used then the next two images or previous two are loaded via ajax with the id of the first image being passed in the url and the HTML for the two new images returned and displayed via ajax simple enough but it got me to thinking on a slow connection or heavy server load then the two images although relatively small thumbnails could still take a while to load and the nice things with sliding panes is the fact that the hidden data slides in quickly and smoothly preferbly without a loading delay So I was wondering from a performance and good practice point of view which option is best this is what I can think of for now open to suggestions 1 call each set of images via JSON its supposed to be fast 2 load all the possible images into a json file and pull in the details that way although browser will still have to load image Plus sometimes there might be 4 images other times there could be upto 1000 3 Load 10 images via php into a Json or other file and load all 10 images into the browser hiding the 8 which are not on show and always showing the middle two Problem here is that each time someone clicks the file has to reload the first and last images which still takes up time although i suppose the middle images will have all been cached via the browser by now though But still there is a loading time 4 Is it possible to have a json image with all the image details regardless of numbers and use no 3 above to load 10 of those images is it possible to use ajax to only read 10 lines and keep a pointer of the last one it read so the json file can be loaded fast short refresh and images either side are cached via the browser Hope thats clear any suggestions on how you would handle this,php

Some devs in our office need training They re working on NET projects and just aren t picking it up very well Their backgrounds are in VB6 Yes In 2008 Go figure I ve been to a couple training courses in the past and they ve fortunately been very good It seems like if you have a good instructor early DevelopMentor NET course and Ted Pattison s SharePoint course were great and you re actively enthusiastic about the subject matter you can get a LOT out of a good week long course My question is whether it s worthwhile for someone who simply might not really care all that much an average dev Are they likely to learn enough or even to magically become inspired to make the investment worth it for the company If so which general NET courses with a C focus would you recommend I always wanted to try JP Boodhoo s course for no other reason than that he is so darn efficient in Visual Studio Resharper and his TDD approach of course,csharp

I have a system which is using phone numbers as unique identifiers For this reason I want to format all phone numbers as they come in using a normalized format Because I have no control over my source data I need to parse out these numbers myself and format them before adding them to my DB I m about to write a parser that can read phone numbers in and output a normalized phone format but before I do I was wondering if anyone knew of any pre existing libraries I could use to format phone numbers If there are no pre existing libraries out there what things should I be keeping in mind when creating this feature that may not be obvious Although my system is only dealing with US numbers right now I plan to try to include support for international numbers just in case since there is a chance it will be needed Edit I forgot to mention I m using C NET 2 0,csharp

I m just getting back into C after a couple of years of doing a lot of C and recently Objective C One thing I ve done before is to roll my own iterator adapter for std map that will deref to just the value part rather than the key value pair This is quite a common and natural thing to do C provides this facility with its Keys and Values properties of its Dictionary class Objective C s NSDictionary similarly has allKeys and allValues Since I ve been away Boost has acquired the Range and ForEach libraries which I am now using extensively I wondered if between the two there was some facility to do the same but I haven t been able to find anything I m thinking of knocking something up using Boost s iterator adapters but before I go down that route I thought I d ask here if anyone knows of such a facility in Boost or somewhere else ready made,cpp

What would be the best way to check that a std vector is sorted Is there something faster than a loop checking that v i lt v i 1 Is it faster cleaner with iterators Or is it actually better to just call sort every time though the v is already sorted case is quite common We can safely assume the vector only contains PODs usually floats and sometimes doubles and ints The size of the vector is non trivial usually a few thousands items but not extreme not gigabyte sized in some instances we ll sort the vector immediately afterwards however there are other instances where we don t it s an error case of our algorithm we already use a flag IsSorted whenever possible,cpp

I need to store sensitive data across few pages run over https per session I can t use session object for the primary reason being that the session store is designed as just as backup store primarily make service calls and load the session If the session has been restarted or in other words that the key in the session does not exist make the service and re populate the session So in the case of user keyed in sensitive data i need to carry this data forward across pages we do not have a persistent store for now therefore option left is storing these sensitive data in Viewstate 1 Should I encrypt the data and store then in Viewstate not recommended though sec amp perf implications OR 2 Should i store the data in a serializable class and store that in Viewstate not recommended again due to perf implications Any opinion please,csharp

Background I have been asked by a client to create a picture of the world which has animated arrows rays that come from one part of the world to another The rays will be randomized will represent a transaction will fade out after they happen and will increase in frequency as time goes on The rays will start in one country s boundary and end in another s As each animated transaction happens a continuously updating sum of the amounts of all the transactions will be shown at the bottom of the image The amounts of the individual transactions will be randomized There will also be a year showing on the image that will increment every n seconds The randomization summation and incrementing are not a problem for me but I am at a loss as to how to approach the animation of the arrows rays My question is what is the best way to do this What frameworks libraries are best suited for this job I am most fluent in python so python suggestions are most easy for me but I am open to any elegant way to do this The client will present this as a slide in a presentation in a windows machine,python

these are just my wonderings and I thought I d share them Simply put MVC is the pattern for separating contents model from presentation view and having a mechanism in place controller defining how to gather both If you already see where I am going at I am very interested to hear your opinion on the matter Of course MVC applies to serverside mechanics and all but think out of the box here with me for a second Visitors of the web both human and robot Google will be likely to see HTML and what comes with it Writing structured and meaningful HTML together with separating it from presentation using CSS has become more important over the years and future technology such as HTML5 only contributes to this separation by offering a more content focused set of elements and mechanisms for working with the pure visual representation Considering all this I was wondering if it would be correct in some way to say that the MVC paradigm applies to the front end as well where The model would be HTML as in the pure httpwise contents that it has become The view being CSS it makes your content be presented a certain way The controller being the webserver and all that lies underneath it is what gathers and separates the model and view and does all the decision making Makes sense Not Thanks Martin Update VonC pointed me to an article that definitely changed my thoughts on the controller part The browser takes up a major part of the controller too as it handles a great deal of user interaction and how the model and view work together,html

There is an application with an extensive object graph This graph mainly consists of a set of subgraphs which are connected to the rest of the graph through the only reference But internally each such subgraph has some number of cross references among objects Once in a while such a sub graph needs to be thrown away Would it be enough just to set to null the only referece which points to that subgraph to make it eligible for garbage collection My concern is that internal cross references may protect the entire subgraph from garbage collection In other words is the garbage collector wise enough to figure out that all references in a subgraph do not leave the boundaries of the subgraph and therefore entire subgraph can be purged,java

I have a VS 2005 C project that uses a special Plugin folder to load extra DLLs for use as nodes in an asset conversion process I have a mixture of C and C DLLs in this folder The issue I have is that when Shadow Copying is enabled the C DLLs refuse to load using Assembly LoadFrom I have attempted to create a custom app domain and used Load but this also failed Finally I tried reading the DLL in as byte data and using Load on that again only the C DLLs would work this way with an error Additional information Unverifiable code failed policy check Exception from HRESULT 0x80131402 An article on the net prompted me to attempt to use clr safe when building that particular DLL but then it simply failed to build due to thousands of errors in Microsoft code apparently With Shadow Copying disabled LoadFrom works fine for all DLLs The app is itself a plugin for Maya and this used to work with Maya 8 5 but fails with 2008 2009 if Shadow Copying is enabled We really would prefer to use Shadow Copying because it prevents DLL file locks when the app is running the Plugins folder is stored in a location that Perforce can update while the app is running Any ideas as to how I can persuade Shadow Copying to work with a custom folder AND a mix of C C DLLs without these problems,csharp

I am writing an application which blocks on input from two istreams Reading from either istream is a synchronous blocking call so I decided to create two Boost threads to do the reading Either one of these threads can get to the end based on some input received and once the end is reached both input streams stop receiving Unfortunately I cannot know which will do so Thus I cannot join on both threads because only one thread cannot be predetermined which one will actually return unblock I must somehow force the other to exit but it is blocked waiting for input so it cannot itself decide it is time to return condition variables or what not Is their a way to either Send a signal a boost thread or Force an istream to fail or Kill a Boost thread Note One of the istreams is cin I am trying to restart the process so I cannot close the input streams in a way that prohibits reseting them Edit I do know when the end is reached and I do know which thread has successfully finished and which needs to be killed Its the killing I need to figure out or a different strategy for reading from an istream I need both threads to exit and cleanup properly Thanks,cpp

Right now we ve got web pages that show UI elements and web pages that just process form submissions and then redirect back to the UI pages They do this using PHP s header function header Location other_page php This causes a 302 Found response to be sent according to the HTTP 1 1 spec 302 is for cases where The requested resource resides temporarily under a different URI HTTP 1 1 spec Functionally this is fine but it doens t seem like this is the proper status code for what we re doing It looks like 303 See Other is the appropriate status here so I m wondering if there s any reason not to use it We d have to be more explicit in our use of header since we d have to specify that status line rather than just a Location field Thoughts,php

Just starting to explore the wonders of regex Being someone who learns from trial and error I m really struggling because my trials are throwing up a disproportionate amount of errors My experiments are in PHP using ereg Anyway I work with first and last names separately but for now using the same regex So far I have A Z a zA Z Any length string that starts with a capital and has only letters capital or not for the rest But where I fall apart is dealing with the special situations that can pretty much occur anywhere Hyphenated Names Worthington Smythe Names with Apostophies D Angelo Names with Spaces Van der Humpton capitals in the middle which may or may not be required is way beyond my interest at this stage Joint Names Ben amp Jerry Maybe there s some other way a name can be that I m no thinking of but I suspect if I can get my head around this I can add to it I m pretty sure there will be instances where more than one of these situations comes up in one name So I think the bottom line is to have my regex also accept a space hyphens ampersands and apostrophes but not at the start or end of the name to be technically correct,php

In an XCode project if I use std cout to write to the console the output is fine However if I use std wcout I get no output I know that this is a thorny issue in C and I ve been googling around to try and find a specific solution in the XCode case A couple of things I found that it was suggested should work were std cout imbue std locale and std setlocale LC_ALL Neither of these have made any difference Before I resign myself to spending the next couple of weeks studying the facets API just to be able to write to the console I thought I d check with the esteemed audidence here Update I think the reason for the problem I ve been having is actually to do with the specific encoding of some of the strings I m trying to print If I send just a string literal using the L my string syntax it works It appears this is using UTF32 little endian encoding However I ve been mixing this with strings I ve been passed from Objective C code using NSUTF32BigEndianStringEncoding encoding It s this mix of encodings that s causing the problems I think we can consider this matter closed Thanks for reading,cpp

Optimization of PHP code via runtime benchmarking is straight forward Keep track of start and end times via microtime around a code block I am not looking for an answer that involves microtime usage What I would like to do is measure the time it takes PHP to get prepared to run it s code code parse op code tree building time My reasoning is that while it s easy to just include every class that you might need for every page that you have on a site the CPU overhead can t be free I d like to know how expensive parse time really is I am assuming that an opcode cache such as APC is not part of the scenario Would I be correct that measurement of parse time in PHP is something that would have to take place in mod_php EDIT If possible taking into account _SERVER DOCUMENT_ROOT usage in code would be helpful Command solutions might take a bit of tinkering to do this but still be valuable answers,php

I ve got a project which requires a fairly complicated process and I want to make sure I know the best way to do this I m using ASP net C with Adobe Flex 3 The app server is Mosso cloud server and the file storage server is Amazon S3 The existing site can be viewed at NoiseTrade com I need to do this Allow users to upload MP3 files to an album widget After the user has uploaded their album widget I need to automatically zip the mp3 for other users to download and upload the zip along with the mp3 tracks to Amazon S3 I actually have this working already using client side processing in Flex but this no longer works because of Adobe s flash 10 security update So now I need to implement this server side The way I am thinking of doing this is Store the mp3 in a temporary folder on the app server When the artist publishes create a zip of the files in that folder using a c library Start the amazon S3 upload process zip and mp3s and email the user when it is finished as well as deleting the temporary folder The major problem I see with this approach is that if a user deletes or adds a track later on I ll have to update the zip file but the temporary files will not longer exist I m at a loss at the best way to do this and would appreciate any advice you might have Thanks,csharp
On a recent project I have been working on in C ASP NET I have some fairly complicated JavaScript files and some nifty Style Sheets As these script resources grow in size it is advisable to minify the resources and keep your web pages as light as possible of course I know many developers who hand feed their JavaScript resources into compressors after debugging and then deploy their applications When it comes to source control and automated builds in the satisfying world of continuous integration thank you CruiseControl NET hand compression will simply not do The only way to maintain source control and offer compressed resources is to keep JS CSS source amp their minified brethren in a separate directory structure Then register only one set of resources or the other in code behind However if a developer makes a change to JS CSS source and then fails to re compact it and check in both versions then you      re code line is now out of sync Not to mention inelegant I am thinking that it would be nice to write a custom executable if one does not exist yet for the CC NET task block which would find and compress all JavaScript and CSS resources in the target directory after the build action but before the asp net publish to target This way developers would only work on JS and CSS source and users would only get the minified resources Is there an application that already performs this task and if not what kind of resource s should I look to install on the build server to have CC NET execute The closest question I could find here to this one required NAnt which is not an option in my case EDIT Dave Ward now has a great article on how to automatically minify in Visual Studio at his site,javascript

Background I m trying out Scons by setting up a basic C sample project that has two sub projects Prj1 is an EXE that depends on Prj2 Prj2 is a DLL that exports some functions The problem I m running into is that the library builds its obj pdb lib dll etc files in the same directory as it s SConscript file while the EXE builds its files in the same directory as its SConscript The application successfully builds both the Prj2 dependency and itself However you cannot run the resulting EXE because it can t find the library it needs because it is in the other directory Question How can I get multiple projects that have dependences to output their binaries and debug information into a common directory so that they can be executed and debugged Potential Solutions This is what I have thought of so far I tried using VariantDir previously called BuildDir however this doesn t seem to work Perhaps I m messing something up here I could potentially tell the compiler and the linker explicitly via Fo Fd for example where to drop their files is this the best or only solution Execute a copy command on the resulting binaries this seems like a hack and quite a pain to manage maintain Update I updated the File Structure and file contents below to reflect the working solution in it s entirety Thanks to grieve for his insight Command With this configuration you must unfortunately execute the

Using LINQ to Entities sounds like a great way to query against a database and get actual CLR objects that I can modify data bind against and so forth But if I perform the same query a second time do I get back references to the same CLR objects or an entirely new set I do not want multiple queries to generate an ever growing number of copies of the same actual data The problem here is that I could alter the contents of one entity and save it back to the database but another instance of the entity is still in existence elsewhere and holding the old data,csharp

OK first some background I am busy automating our build process We run a mixture of Vs 2005 and VS 2008 both targeting platform 2 0 We use Nant to do our builds using the MSBUILD task to do the compile and Cruise Control net to do our CI Currently we treat all warnings as errors fail the build if any FxCop rules fail except a small subset that we disabled fail the build if Simian detects any code duplication of more than 5 lines across all projects I have written NDepend CQL query to enforce a few rules that are hard to implement in FxCop I want to fail the build if the number of lines in a method class breach a certain limit I also want to fail if the cyclomatic complexity of a method is too high I can easily run NDepend as part of my build But I can t get the build to fail if my CQL queries return results 0 So this is the question Has anybody tried something similar Is there a Nant task that supports this If there is a Nant task that calls NDepend but doesn t fail the build is the source available so I can add this feature Thanks Stephen,csharp

I am working on a large project that uses the STL and have a question about your preferred way to organise your STL includes Do you prefer to include each header in the source file it is used For example if both foo cpp and bar cpp require std string then both will include lt string gt Do you prefer to have a single header file that includes all the STL headers your project uses i e add them to the MS stdafx h pre compiled header The advantage of the first method is that the cpp file is an independent unit and can be used in a different project without having to worry that you re missing a include The advantages of the second method is that you can take use your compilers pre compiled header support plus you can wrap STL includes in pragmas that disable some warnings for example some Boost headers will cause warnings when compiling at level 4 Which do you prefer to use,cpp

When looking at C code I often see patterns like this DataType items GetSomeItems OtherDataType itemProps new OtherDataType items Length int i 0 foreach DataType item in items Do some stuff with item then finally itemProps i item Prop i The for loop iterates over the objects in items but also keeping a counter i for iterating over itemProps as well I personally don t like this extra i hanging around and instead would probably do something like DataType items GetSomeItems OtherDataType itemProps new OtherDataType items Length for int i 0 i lt items Length i Do some stuff with items i then finally itemProps i items i Prop Is there perhaps some benfit to the first approach I m not aware of Is this a result of everybody trying to use that fancy foreach syntax I m interested in your opinions on this,csharp

My class contains a Dictionary lt T S gt dict and I want to expose a ReadOnlyCollection lt T gt of the keys How can I do this without copying the Dictionary lt T S gt KeyCollection dict Keys to an array and then exposing the array as a ReadOnlyCollection I want the ReadOnlyCollection to be a proper wrapper ie to reflect changes in the underlying Dictionary and as I understand it copying the collection to an array will not do this as well as seeming inefficient I don t actually want a new collection just to expose the underlying collection of keys Any ideas would be much appreciated Edit I m using C 2 0 so don t have extension methods such as ToList easily available,csharp

I have a DataSet with a DataTable that correctly fills a single DataRow through a TableAdapter I am able to pull data from the DataRow with code like this dataFileID int this dataFileDataRow DataFileID dataFileName string this dataFileDataRow DataFileName dataFileDate DateTime this dataFileDataRow DataFileDate I have another column called DataFile of type varbinary max When I try to pull that column s data from the same DataRow as above I get nothing byte fileFromDatabase byte this dataFileDataRow DataFile If I put a break point at this location I can look into the dataFileDataRow look into the ItemArray property and see that the binary data is sitting at position 5 in the ItemArray I have tried access the ItemArray directly using its index but the byte array is not being copied to the fileFromDatabase variable I have also noticed that adding fileFromDatabase to my watch produces this error The name fileFromDatabase does not exist in the current context The execution is still in the same block as the definition of fileFromDatabase so I do not understand how it would be out of context I had Visual Studio s configuration set to Release instead of Debug This was causing me to not see the real time debugging information I was looking for when trying to examine fileFromDatabase After switching from Release to Debug I am able to see the variable in the watch now and can verify that the code above is working correctly,csharp

Similar to List lt gt OrderBy Alphabetical Order we want to sort by one element then another we want to achieve the functional equivalent of SELECT from Table ORDER BY x y We have a class that contains a number of sorting functions and we have no issues sorting by one element For example public class MyClass public int x public int y List lt MyClass gt MyList public void SortList MyList Sort MySortingFunction And we have the following in the list Unsorted Sorted x Desired ID x y ID x y ID x y 0 0 1 2 0 2 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 2 0 2 2 0 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 Stable sort would be preferable but not required Solution that works for Net 2 0 is welcome,csharp

In a code review I stumbled over this simplified code fragment to unregister an event handler Fire new MyDelegate OnFire I thought that this does not unregister the event handler because it creates a new delegate which had never been registered before But searching MSDN I found several code samples which use this idiom So I started an experiment internal class Program public delegate void MyDelegate string msg public static event MyDelegate Fire private static void Main string args Fire new MyDelegate OnFire Fire new MyDelegate OnFire Fire Hello 1 Fire new MyDelegate OnFire Fire Hello 2 Fire new MyDelegate OnFire Fire Hello 3 private static void OnFire string msg Console WriteLine OnFire 0 msg To my surprise the following happened Fire Hello 1 produced two messages as expected Fire Hello 2 produced one message This convinced me that unregistering new delegates works Fire Hello 3 threw a NullReferenceException Debugging the code showed that Fire is null after unregistering the event I know that for event handlers and delegate the compiler generates a lot of code behind the scene But I still don t understand why my reasoning is wrong What am I missing Additional question from the fact that Fire is null when there are no events registered I conclude that everywhere an event is fired a check against null is required,csharp
I have a Java SOAP data service which sits on top of a Sybase database which for reasons out of my control has unreliable performance The database is part of a vendor package which has been modified by an internal team and most of the issues are caused by slow response times at certain times of the day The SOAP service provides data to a calculation grid and when I request data I need the response time to be both fast and consistent The service provides basic CRUD functionality but the ratio of reads to writes is approximately 100 1 What is the best strategy to isolate myself from the database s unreliable performance and ensure that the SOAP service is fast and reliable,java

The application de serializes a stream into dynamically allocated objects and then keeps base type pointers in a linked list i e abstract factory It s too slow Profiling says all the time is spent in operator new Notes The application already uses a custom memory allocator that does pooling The compiler is VC 6 0 and the code uses the old RogueWave collections rather than the STL The only idea I have right now is to introduce Object Pooling I d maintain large collections of pre allocated objects for each type and re use them But this will be a lot of work in this old code and I m not yet sure there s enough re use that it would even help I was hoping someone smarter than me has an idea,cpp

I am having a similar issue to this person The primary difference being the application is NOT meant for a developer environment and therefore I need to know how to optimize the space used by Sql Server possibly per machine based on specs I was intrigued by Ricardo C s answer particularly the following Extracted fromt he SQL Server documentation Maximum server memory in MB Specifies the maximum amount of memory SQL Server can allocate when it starts and while it runs This configuration option can be set to a specific value if you know there are multiple applications running at the same time as SQL Server and you want to guarantee that these applications have sufficient memory to run If these other applications such as Web or e mail servers request memory only as needed then do not set the option because SQL Server will release memory to them as needed However applications often use whatever memory is available when they start and do not request more if needed If an application that behaves in this manner runs on the same computer at the same time as SQL Server set the option to a value that guarantees that the memory required by the application is not allocated by SQL Server My question is how does an application request memory from the OS when it needs it Is this something built into compilation or something managed by the developer The two primary apps running on this machine are Sql Server and the fairly heavyweight C application I m developing and I m almost certain we didn t specifically do anything in the realm of asking the OS for memory Is there a correct necessary way to do this,csharp

We re looking into transport protocol solutions and were about to do various performance tests so I thought I d check with the community if they ve already done this Has anyone done server performance tests for simple echo services as well as serialization deserialization for various messages sizes comparing EJB3 Thrift and Protocol Buffers on Linux Primarily languages will be Java C C Python and PHP Update I m still very interested in this if anyone has done any further benchmarks please let me know Also very interesting benchmark showing compressed JSON performing similar better than Thrift Protocol Buffers so I m throwing JSON into this question as well,java

I have spent several hours trying to find a means of writing a cross platform password prompt in php that hides the password that is input by the user While this is easily accomplished in Unix environments through the use of stty echo I have tried various means of passthru and system calls to make windows do the same thing to no avail I have tried passthru set p pass Password system echo pass gt out txt pass file_get_contents out txt r This seems to hang on the passthru set p pass Password line without allowing me to input any text and must be killed with a Ctrl c I have also tried various methods of fgetc and fgets and printing backspace characters to hide the input since this works in other languages However PHP does not appear to be able to interact with text prior to a carriage return I would really like to find a way to make this work is this an impossible task or is this something that can be done Note that I am aware that I could wrap the php script in a batch file and pass the password as a command line argument but that doesn t work for me in this case,php
There are a number of great Javascript libraries frameworks out there jQuery Prototype MooTools etc but they all seem to focus on DOM interaction and AJAX functionality I haven t found any that focus on extending the built in data types String Date Number etc And by Extending I mean methods to solve typical work a day problems we all have An example would be the NET String Format method Not only more convenient but makes reading and trouble shooting string concatenation better While I have already created a String prototype method for this I d like to see if a good library has already been developed to address similar productivity issues before launching into a library of my own Prototype has a few interesting methods in this regard but since I ve already settled on jQuery for DOM work I really don t need to duplicate functionality on every page Is anyone aware of a good lean data type productivity library for Javascript,javascript

I am absolutely new to the NET world and started with C on friday I have some experience with database apps though We will go with LINQ to SQL for a medium scale project I am used to generating my schema from classes and keep track of changes with subversion and equivalents to Ruby s Migrations There obviously is no easy way to do this with LINQ itself So I thought of generating the schema and do some data access with Castle Project s ActiveRecord and use Migrator NET Tarantino or dbdeploy net for the schema updates Any suggestions for this My main question is How do I verify that my LINQ classes still match the database schema Does LINQ throw exceptions if the schema does not match Can I iterate over all the LINQ classes and invoke some verify method I already found that sqlmetal is the way to regenerate the classes PS We will use SQL Server 2008 or 2005,csharp
Is it possible to change java lookandfeel without modifying the program in a real world environment I know that theoretically the answer is yes I also created demo applications and changed the lookandfeel even at runtime and it worked But when I created a real application with lots of controls lookandfeel change was not really working Different lookandfeels have different bugs or strange features For instance some of them creates the same style for JTextField and JFormattedTextField some of them uses different styles This change can be quite annoying for users Control sizes are not the same using different fonts different borders so sometimes the window looks ugly after change Keyboard shortcuts can also be different In my applications after lookandfeel change actually instead of changing the lookandfeel I tried using the same lookandfeel with different skins I always have to modify the application Not a very big modification but lots of small modifications which makes lookandfeel change difficult Am I just very unlucky with the lookandfeels I tried currently using skinlf or lookandfeel change is not that easy as in small demo applications UPDATE I m using Swing and changing to other GUI library is not possible for me right now UPDATE2 It seems to me the question was not clear I do know how to change the lookandfeel My questions is Is it possible to create a real application where changing lookandfeel or the skin of the lookandfeel is an easy task Currently if I change the lookandfeel it is not enough to change 2 or 3 lines I have to review the whole application and fix quite a few problems caused by the lookandfeel change dhiller suggested replacing skinlf with a better lookandfeel Can you show me a skinable lookandfeel where skin replacement works better,java

Long ago I wrote a style normalizer program to scan the ASP HTML code of a big pile of classic ASP pages most of which were originally generated from MS Word documents so naturally they were littered with superflous stylesheets and massive one off styles The style normalizer generated a minimal set of stylesheets and styles and a new sanitized asp html document so that the sanitized document produced exactly the same rendered output as the original verified with screenshot image comparisons Every now and then I run across a need for a program like this and am toying with the idea of writing one for commercial release My googling skills have not turned up anything exactly like this HTML Normalize Perl module and HTML Tidy project just seem to clean up tags So my questions are is there such a tool already commercial or otherwise if not does anybody really need it if so what features would make it truly worthwhile re 3 for example collecting a base stylesheet for a set of pages or adjusting all pages to use a given base stylesheet preserving classic asp commands following includes preserving asp net embedded scripts et al The more specific and numerous the better Example Old html w embedded tags lt html gt lt head gt lt title gt title lt title gt lt style type css text gt cls1 font family arial font size 10px font weight bold lt style gt lt head gt lt body gt lt somefunction gt lt div class cls1 style font size 10px gt test div lt div gt lt body gt lt html gt New html lt html gt lt head gt lt title gt title lt title gt lt style type css text gt cls1 font family arial font size 10px font weight bold lt style gt lt head gt lt body gt lt somefunction gt lt div class cls1 gt test div lt div gt lt body gt lt html gt Note that the style on the div is gone since it was redundant with the class cls1 EDIT removed the term sanitizer since i m not focused on XSS attacks or filtering input in comments merely on consolidating a lot of ad hoc styles and random CSS classes into a minimal coherent set of stylesheets,html

Good morning Apologies for the newbie question I m just getting started with ASP NET internationalization settings Background info I have a website which displays a lt table gt HTML object In that lt table gt HTML object I have a column which displays dates My server being in the US those dates show up as MM DD YYYY Many of my users plug into this webpage through Excel via the Data Import External Data Import Web Query interface My users for the most part are in the US so those dates show up correctly in their Excel screens Now I need to make the webpage work for UK users As is they are downloading the dates as MM DD YYYY which makes their spreadsheets unusable since their regional settings are set to DD MM YYYY My question is How do I make it so the web server realizes that the incoming request has a en GB culture setting I could engineer my own little custom workaround but I m sure I m not the first programmer to come across this How do the pro s handle this I m looking for a solution that would be relatively simple and quick to put up but I don t want to just put some crappy buggy piece of my own logic togethe that I m going to dread 6 months from now Thanks a lot in advance Alan,csharp

I m trying to implement a dynamic OPTION list in JavaScript Depending on other selections in the web form some of the OPTIONS in a specific SELECT are not valid Things I ve tried that don t work in IE are populate all options then set the disabled property for those that are invalid populate all options and use option groups then disable invalid option groups I even tried using a style of text decoration line through At this point I m resigned to repopulating the SELECT with only valid OPTIONs but it seems like there ought to be a better way that actually works in IE I require compatibility with IE6 and up How have you dealt with this,html

I am experiencing a crash while using the Boost Spirit and Boost Thread libraries in my application This only happens if I have used the Spirit parser during the lifetime of the process from the main thread The crash happens at exit and appears to be related to the clean up of thread specific storage allocated by the Spirit parser It is probably crashing due to the sequence of which DLLs are unloaded as the thread specific memory is allocated inside a DLL that has already been unloaded The Boost Thread DLL is however not unloaded untill the application itself exits Is there a way for me to force Spirit to clean out its thread specific storage e g in my dll main when i get a process detach notification Any solutions hints would be appreciated PS My platform and settings Visual Studio 2005 BOOST_ALL_DYN_LINK BOOST_SPIRIT_THREADSAFE,cpp

I m currently building a Gridview that has expandable rows Each row contains a dynamically created Panel of Form elements Right now I have a javascript function that expands or in my case makes visible the panel when an Image is clicked on the Gridview row My question is is there a more efficient way of doing this Instead of pulling all my data to begin with and building each new row as I Databind is there a way to simple create the row with the Panel full of textboxes and dropdownlists on the fly when the user clicks the Expand button I d like to limit the server calls by doing it that way instead of how I m currently doing it looping through every row and creating a new panel with form elements and inserting that into a row that is hidden,javascript

When using the Ajax BeginForm helper in ASP Net MVC I can pass options with names of different functions for example one to run OnBegin one for OnSuccess etc How do these work under the hood The reason I m asking is that I m extending this to provide a JQuery based alternative and I need to figure out how to get from having the method names specified in a JSON string to actually calling them The AjaxOptions class has a method for serializing in which it wraps the method name in the following way in this example the AjaxOptions OnSuccess property is set to mySuccessFunction p onSuccess Function createDelegate this mySuccessFunction p I have produced my own JQueryAjaxOptions class which serializes in the same way but with some extra options available So asically what I have available in my method for posting the form is the above property as part of a json object and I need to be able to call the function How can I accomplish this,javascript
I have a field in my form labeled Name that will contain both the First amp Last name Our existing dynamic server to which the form is being POSTed to expects two separate fields first name last name Can I use Javascript to split the user input into two separate variables before the form is posted to the server How would I do this,javascript
I m have a ADO DataSet that I m loading from its XML file via ReadXml The data and the schema are in separate files Right now it takes close to 13 seconds to load this DataSet I can cut this to 700 milliseconds if I don t read the DataSet s schema and just let ReadXml infer the schema but then the resulting DataSet doesn t contain any constraints I ve tried doing this Console WriteLine Reading dataset with external schema ds ReadXmlSchema xsdPath Console WriteLine Reading the schema took 0 milliseconds sw ElapsedMilliseconds foreach DataTable dt in ds Tables dt BeginLoadData ds ReadXml xmlPath Console WriteLine ReadXml completed after 0 milliseconds sw ElapsedMilliseconds foreach DataTable dt in ds Tables dt EndLoadData Console WriteLine Process complete at 0 milliseconds sw ElapsedMilliseconds When I do this reading the schema takes 27ms and reading the DataSet takes 12000 milliseconds And that s the time reported before I call EndLoadData on all the DataTables This is not an enormous amount of data it s about 1 5mb there are no nested relations and all of the tables contain two or three columns of 6 30 characters The only thing I can figure that s different if I read the schema up front is that the schema includes all of the unique constraints But BeginLoadData is supposed to turn constraints off as well as change notification etc So that shouldn t apply here And yes I ve tried just setting EnforceConstraints to false I ve read many reports of people improving the load time of DataSets by reading the schema first instead of having the object infer the schema In my case inferring the schema makes for a process that s about 20 times faster than having the schema provided explicitly This is making me a little crazy This DataSet s schema is generated off of metainformation and I m tempted to write a method that creates it programatically and just deseralizes it with an XmlReader But I d much prefer not to What am I missing What else can I do to improve the speed here,csharp
C 3 0 Extension methods add extensions to the base Type making calling that method on all instances of that Type legal Now JavaScript I know implements IDispatchEx through which it s possible to add methods to a specific instance So how do I add a set of methods to an instance of a C class I know this is a Dynamic vs Static Languages holy war territory Let me clarify my intention is NOT that I just want to be able to add a set of events to an interface depending on the class implementing that interface I was able to do that using Generics inteface ISample lt T gt T SupportedEvents class Sample ISample lt UIWidgetEvent gt class Sample2 ISample lt NonVisualUIWidget gt class UIWidgetEvent public EventHandler Clicked class NonVisualUIWidget public EventHandler Expired class TestSample public void Test new Sample SupportedEvents Clicked new Sample2 SupportedEvents Expired Then I didn t like SupportedEvents I want to be able to say new Sample Clicked Then I thought JavaScript I know C is not JS AND IDispatchEx IL Weaving Reflection Emit etc etc and thought may be there s a way to do this Design time support would be nice but I can live without Yes I probably could do this instance augmentation with a Visitor pattern Not sure if I could get the syntatic sugar though Comments,csharp

I keep seeing people say that exceptions are slow but I never see any proof So instead of asking if they are I will ask how do exceptions work behind the scene so I can make a decisions of when to use them and if they are slow From what I know exceptions are the same thing as doing a bunch of return but it also checks when it needs to stop doing the return How does it check when to do stop I am taking a guess and saying there is a second stack which holds the type of exception and stack location then does returns until it gets there I am also guessing the only time that stack is touch is on a throw and every try catch AFAICT implementing a similar behaviour with return code would take the same amount of time But this is all a guess so I want to know How do exceptions really work,cpp

I have a few things that I cannot find a good way to perform in Visual Studio Pre build step invokes a code generator that generates some source files which are later compiled This can be solved to a limited extent by adding blank files to the project which are later replaced with real generated files but it does not work if I don t know names and or the number of auto generated source files I can easily solve it in GNU make using wildcard generated c How can I do something similar with Visual Studio Can I prevent pre build post build event running if the files do not need to be modified make behaviour The current workaround is to write a wrapper script that will check timestamps for me which works but is a bit clunky What is a good way to locate external libraries and headers installed outside of VS In nix case they would normally be installed in the system paths or located with autoconf I suppose I can specify paths with user defined macros in project settings but where is a good place to put these macros so they can be easily found and adjusted Just to be clear I am aware that better Windows build systems exist CMake SCons but they usually generate VS project files themselves and I need to integrate this project into existing VS build system so it is desirable that I have just plain VS project files not generated ones,cpp
I have a NET C WPF application that I am trying to make into a single instance application using a Mutex This NET application is called by a C based DLL using CreateProcessAsUser and is given parameters via environment variables Subsequent instances will also be created by the C DLL in the same way Subsequent instances would then need to pass their parameters to the first instance of the application before exiting The problem is what methods can be used in the NET application so that the subsequent instances would be able to pass their data to the first instance of the NET application The simpler the better I have researched some but I hope there are simpler ways Things I have researched Named Pipes NET Remoting Windows Messaging Sending WM_COPYDATA to the first instance window Since I am just trying to pass 4 strings to the first instance I am trying to avoid the above mentioned methods because they are somewhat overkill for my problem The simplest I can think of is to export a function from the NET application so that the subsequent instances of the NET application can just call this function on the first instance of the NET application and pass the data as the parameters of the function However is this possible in NET I ve read that NET EXE or DLLs could not export functions Thanks,csharp

In Java what is the difference between the twin methods public void methodA throws AnException do something throw new AnException public void methodA do the same thing throw new AnException I have a intuition that it has something to do with being a well designed method because I put methodA in an interface declared it the way methodA does in its implementation and received a warning from Java that A cannot override A because A doesn t throw AnException Is this speculation correct Is there any other subtle connotations in the two ways of doing things,java

Here s what I m trying to do and failing I have a File model which has a generic relation to other objects class File models Model content_type models ForeignKey ContentType object_id models PositiveIntegerField content_object generic GenericForeignKey file models FileField upload_to files Y m d etc I also want to have a sub class of File to deal with the specific case of images to be displayed in page rather than downloaded class Image File file models ImageField upload_to files Y m d All of the above works fine including generic inlines of the File model until I want to use a generic inline of the Image model the save process fails to create the base class instance and so raises an error stating that the Image file_ptr the secret foreign key to the base class cannot be None So basically generic inlines do not properly support multi table inheritance at the moment It s quite likely that I m making this more complicated than it need be so can anyone suggest either a fix for this problem or a better way of achieving the same end Please let me know if you need further clarification,python
I m trying to read data from a csv file to ouput it on a webpage as text It s the first time I m doing this and I ve run into a nasty little problem My csv file which gets openened by Excel by default has multiple rows and I read the entire thing as one long string like this contents file_get_contents files data csv In this example file I made there are 2 lines Paul Blueberryroad 85 us Flashlight Bag November 20 2008 4 39 pm Hellen Blueberryroad 85 us lens13mm Flashlight Bag ExtraBatteries November 20 2008 16 41 32 But the string read by PHP is this Paul Blueberryroad 85 us Flashlight Bag November 20 2008 4 39 pmHellen Blueberryroad 85 us lens13mm Flashlight Bag ExtraBatteries November 20 2008 16 41 32 I m splitting this with list name street country accessories orderdate split contents What I want is for name to contain Paul and Hellen as its contents And the other arrays to receive the values of their respective columns Instead I get only Paul and the content of orderdate is November 20 2008 4 39 pmHellen So all the rows are concatenated Can someone show me how i can achieve what I need EDIT solution found just one werid thing remaining I ve solved it now by using this piece of code fo fopen files users csv rb while feof fo contents fgetcsv fo 0 fclose fo For some reason allthough my CSV file only has 2 rows it returns 2 arrays and 1 boolean The first 2 are my data arrays and the boolean is 0,php

I have floated images and inset boxes at the top of a container using float right or left many times Recently I hit a need to float a div at the bottom right corner of another div with the normal text wrap that you get with float text wrapped above and to the left only I thought this must be relatively easy even though float has no bottom value but I haven t been able to do it using a number of techniques and searching the web hasn t come up with anything other than using absolute positioning but this doesn t give the correct word wrap behaviour I had thought this would be a very common design but apparently it isn t If nobody has a suggestion I ll have to break my text up into separate boxes and align the div manually but that is rather precarious and I d hate to have to do it on every page that needs it,html

I know that buffer overruns are one potential hazard to using C style strings char arrays If I know my data will fit in my buffer is it okay to use them anyway Are there other drawbacks inherent to C style strings that I need to be aware of EDIT Here s an example close to what I m working on char buffer 1024 char line NULL while line fgets fp NULL this won t compile but that s not the issue parse one line of command output here This code is taking data from a FILE pointer that was created using a popen df command I m trying to run Linux commands and parse their output to get information about the operating system Is there anything wrong or dangerous with setting the buffer to some arbitrary size this way,cpp
On a more abstract level then a previous question in my experience there are 3 ways to call a javascript function on an html page from an embedded swf using AS3 ExternalInterface fscommand and navigateToURL Let s compare and contrast these methods and maybe others I haven t listed and talk about the pros and cons of each right now ExternalInterface seems like the way to go in terms of flexibility but is it right for all situations Are there concrete benefits in terms of execution speed or anything like that I m curious what do we think,javascript
I m writing a little web based utility for my brother who needs to merge columns in a CSV file I know things like this surely exist somewhere but a large part of this is that is a fun little exercise Anyways I m trying to figure out the best neatest way to present the part of the UI where he reorders the columns and chooses which columns get merged The jQuery UI selectable interaction provides about 85 of what I need the simple reordering of the columns but I m having a bit of a rough time with the merging What I m trying to do is make it so that merged columns become a nested list under a single item For example lt ul id columns gt lt li gt Column 1 lt li gt lt li gt Column 2 lt li gt lt ul gt would become lt ul id columns gt lt li gt Column 1 lt ul class merge gt lt li gt Column 2 lt li gt lt ul gt lt li gt lt ul gt This is proving to be a bit more of a pain than I anticipated so I was wondering if anyone had any ideas for a better way to present the overall UI I m fairly comfortable in jQuery so bonus points if it can be done in jQuery D dylanfm This isn t tabular data it s just a list of column names but no actual data Besides the specific HTML element I use is hardly at the heart of what I m asking smo I like the simplicity of your idea but the problem is that there are several dozen different columns so listing every column once per column would unfortunately be out of the question strager That s pretty much exactly what I ve been trying to do it s just that particulars of making UI respond the way I want have been giving me problems I ll give you the answer for now and I guess it s back to the salt mines for me,jquery

I m working with LINQ to objects and have a function where in some cases I need to modify the underlying collection before calling Aggregate and then return it to its original state before the funciton returns the results of Aggregate My current code looks something like this bool collectionModified false if collectionNeedsModification modifyCollection collectionModified true var aggregationResult from a in from b in collection where b SatisfysCondition Aggregate aggregationFunction select a NeededValue if collectionModified modifyCollection return aggregationResult However as written if I modify the collection I will get the wrong result because I m putting the collection back in its original state before aggregationResult is enumerated and LINQ results are lazy evaluated My current solution is to use ToArray on my LINQ query like this var aggregationResult from a in from b in collection where b SatisfysCondition Aggregate aggregationFunction select a NeededValue ToArray The size of the resulting array will always be small lt 100 items so memory processing time is not a concern Is this the best way to handle my problem or is there a better way to force the evaluation of a LINQ query,csharp

Executive Summary When assertion errors are thrown in the threads the unit test doesn t die This makes sense since one thread shouldn t be allowed to crash another thread The question is how do I either 1 make the whole test fail when the first of the helper threads crashes or 2 loop through and determine the state of each thread after they have all completed see code below One way of doing the latter is by having a per thread status variable e g boolean statuses and have statuses i false mean that the thread failed this could be extended to capture more information However that is not what I want I want it to fail just like any other unit test when the assertion errors are thrown Is this even possible Is it desirable I got bored and I decided to spawn a bunch of threads in my unit test and then have them call a service method just for the heck of it The code looks approximately like Thread threads new Thread MAX_THREADS for int i 0 i lt threads length i threads i new Thread new Runnable private final int ID threadIdSequenceNumber public void run try resultRefs ID runTest Integer toString ID returns an object catch Throwable t this code is EVIL it catches even Errors don t copy it more on this below final String message error testing thread with id gt ID logger debug message t throw new IllegalStateException message t need to wrap throwable in a run time exception so it will compile After this we will loop through the array of threads and start each one After that we will wait for them all to finish Finally we will perform some checks on the result references for Thread thread threads thread start logger debug waiting for threads to finish boolean done false while done done true for Thread thread threads if thread isAlive done false for int i 0 i lt resultRefs length i assertTrue you ve got the world messed dawg myCondition resultRefs i Here s the problem Did you notice that nasty try catch throwable block I just added that as a temporary hack so I could see what was going on In runTest String a few assertions are made e g assertNotNull null but since it is in a different thread it doesn t cause the unit test to fail My guess is that we will need to somehow iterate over the threads array check the status of each and manually cause an assertion error if the thread terminated in a nasty way What s the name of the method that gives this information the stack trace of the dead thread,java

I need help finding resources that would help me or at least point me in the right direction in building a Flash media server PHP application I basically want to improve my current application by instead of progressive download using flash media server so that the videos will not only stream well but they can t be downloaded by the end user What the current application does is show a login form on the homepage and then when logged in the user can then navigate the site by choosing videos from a particular video category or video uploaded by a specific user All this is done with PHP The video page uses progressive download to display the video after the video ID has been passed using PHP I need to know how PHP and flash media server work together Are there any resources out there where I can find a good application example really simple that demonstrates how PHP and flash media server can be used to stream videos dynamically such that PHP checks for the login video ID video channels and video category information while the flash media server streams the video,php

I have a table with a binary column which stores files of a number of different possible filetypes PDF BMP JPEG WAV MP3 DOC MPEG AVI etc but no columns that store either the name or the type of the original file Is there any easy way for me to process these rows and determine the type of each file stored in the binary column Preferably it would be a utility that only reads the file headers so that I don t have to fully extract each file to determine its type Clarification I know that the approach here involves reading just the beginning of each file I m looking for a good resource aka links that can do this for me without too much fuss Thanks Also just C NET on Windows please I m not using Linux and can t use Cygwin doesn t work on Windows CE among other reasons,csharp

Why does the SQLite C C API return unsigned char s for text values as opposed to the more de facto char type This is somewhat related to the unsigned char question except that the SQLite API s decision seems opposite of the conventional char advice given for string like values For example const unsigned char sqlite3_column_text sqlite3_stmt int iCol,cpp
Suppose a and b are both of type int and b is nonzero Consider the result of performing a b in the following cases a and b are both nonnegative a and b are both negative Exactly one of them is negative In Case 1 the result is rounded down to the nearest integer But what does the standard say about Cases 2 and 3 An old draft I found floating on the Internet indicates that it is implementation dependent yes even case 2 but the committee is leaning toward making it always round toward zero Does anyone know what the latest standard says Please answer only based on the standard not what makes sense or what particular compilers do,cpp

I want to write unit tests with NUnit that hit the database I d like to have the database in a consistent state for each test I thought transactions would allow me to undo each test so I searched around and found several articles from 2004 05 on the topic http weblogs asp net rosherove archive 2004 07 12 180189 aspx http weblogs asp net rosherove archive 2004 10 05 238201 aspx http davidhayden com blog dave archive 2004 07 12 365 aspx http haacked com archive 2005 12 28 11377 aspx These seem to resolve around implementing a custom attribute for NUnit which builds in the ability to rollback DB operations after each test executes That s great but Does this functionality exists somewhere in NUnit natively Has this technique been improved upon in the last 4 years Is this still the best way to test database related code Edit it s not that I want to test my DAL specifically it s more that I want to test pieces of my code that interact with the database For these tests to be no touch and repeatable it d be awesome if I could reset the database after each one Further I want to ease this into an existing project that has no testing place at the moment For that reason I can t practically script up a database and data from scratch for each test,csharp

I have set up a sort of introspection enabling C library that allows using minimum macros and a fair amount of template trickery to declare structures and classes that get enriched with some meta information This meta information captures all important details about each field of the struct class that you declare and at the end of the story you are able for each struct class enriched in this way to produce an xml file that dumps for each field its name type len offset etc etc For my problem I don t need to support fields that are pointers but only primitive types arrays and STL containers vectors lists etc The code that populates these meta enriched structs classes the producer at a certain point serializes them for now it s a simple binary dump of all primitive types and of all the buffers used by the STL containers if any Now I need to start developing a reader counterpart that is able at runtime starting from the xml description that has been built by the producer to access the various fields of the stored data I think it s a problem of dynamic data dictionary interpretation but all that I have found up to know is related to read back xml data while I have binary data and an xml description of it What is the best way to start on this Is something out there that resembles this problem and that I could get inspiration from,cpp

Is their a way to use a non member non friend function on an object using the same dot notation as member functions Can I pull a any member out of a class and have users use it in the same way they always have Longer Explanation Scott Meyers Herb Sutter et all argue that non member non friend functions are a part of an object s interface and can improve encapsulation I agree with them However after recently reading this article http www gotw ca gotw 084 htm I find myself questioning the syntax implications In that article Herb proposes having a single insert erase and replace member and several non member non friend functions of the same name Does this mean as I think it does that Herb thinks some functions should be used with the dot notation and others as a global function std string s foobar s insert One like this insert s Others like this Edit Thanks everyone for your very useful answers however I think the point of my question has been overlooked I specifically did not mention the specific case of operators and how they retain the natural notation Nor that you should wrap everything in a namespace These things are written in the article I linked to The question itself was In the article Herb suggests that one insert method be a member while the rest are non member non friend functions This implies that to use one form of insert you have to use dot notation while for the others you do not Is it just me or does that sound crazy I have a hunch that perhaps you can use a single syntax Im thinking how Boost function can take a this parameter for mem_fun,cpp
Let s say I have an existing System Threading Timer instance and I d like to call Change on it to push it s firing time back var timer new Timer DelayCallback null 10000 Timeout Infinite sometime later but before DelayCallback has executed timer Change 20000 Timeout Infinite I m using this timer to perform an idle callback after a period of no activity Idle and no activity are application defined conditions in this case the specifics aren t terribly important Every time I perform an action I want to reset the timer so that it is always set to fire 10 seconds after that However there is an inherent race condition because when I call Change I can t tell if the Timer has already fired based on its old settings I can of course tell if my callback has happened but I can t tell if the CLR s internal timer thread has queued my callback to the threadpool and its execution is imminent Now I know I can call Dispose on the timer instance and re create it each time I need to push it back but this seems less efficient than just changing the existing timer Of course it may not be I ll run some micro benchmarks in a bit and let you all know Alternatively I can always keep track of the expected firing time via DateTime Now AddSeconds 10 and if the original Timer fires ignore it by checking DateTime Now in the callback I have a nagging concern that this may not be 100 reliable on account of the Timer using TimeSpan and my check using DateTime this may not be an issue but I m not completely comfortable with it for some reason My questions are Is there a good way for me to call Timer Change and be able to know whether I managed to change it before the callback was queued to the threadpool I don t think so but it doesn t hurt to ask Has anyone else implemented what I term a pushback timer like this If so I d love to hear how you tackled the problem This question is somewhat hypothetical in nature since I already have a couple of working solutions based on Dispose and based on DateTime Now I m mainly interested in hearing performance related suggestions as I ll be pushing back the Timer VERY frequently Thanks,csharp

Short version is in the title Long version I am working on a program for scientific optimization using Java The workload of the program can be divided into parallel and serial phases parallel phases meaning that highly parallelizable work is being performed To speed up the program it runs for hours days I create a number of threads equal to the number of CPU cores on the machine I m using typically 4 or 8 and divide the work between them I then start these threads and join them before proceeding to a serial phase So far so good What s bothering me is that the CPU utilization and speedup of the parallel phases is nowhere near the theoretical maximum e g if I have 4 cores I expect to see somewhere between 350 400 utilization as reported by top but instead it bounces around between 180 and about 310 Using only a single thread I get 100 CPU utilization The only reasons I know of for threads not to run at full speed are blocking due to I O blocking due to synchronization No I O whatsoever is going on in my parallel threads nor any synchronization the only data structures shared by the threads are read only and are either basic types or non concurrent collections So I m looking for other explanations One possibility would be that several threads are repeatedly blocking for garbage collection but that would only seem to make sense in a situation with memory pressure and I am allocating well above the required maximum heap space Any suggestions would be appreciated Update Just in case anyone is curious after some more investigation I tweaked the code for general performance and am seeing better utilization even though nothing I changed has to do with synchronization However some of the changes should have resulted in fewer new heap allocations in particular I got rid of some use of iterators and termporary boxed numbers The CERN Colt library for high performance Java computing was useful here it provides collections like IntArrayList DoubleArrayList etc for basic types So I think garbage collection was probably the culprit,java
In my application there are 10 20 classes that are instantiated once Here s an example class SomeOtherManager class SomeManagerClass public SomeManagerClass SomeOtherManager virtual void someMethod1 virtual void someMethod2 Instances of the classes are contained in one object class TheManager public virtual SomeManagerClass someManagerClass const virtual SomeOtherManager someOtherManager const More objects up to 10 20 Currently TheManager uses the new operator in order to create objects My intention is to be able to replace using plugins the SomeManagerClass or any other class implementation with another one In order to replace the implementation 2 steps are needed Define a class DerivedSomeManagerClass which inherits SomeManagerClass plugin Create the new class DerivedSomeManagerClass instead of the default SomeManagerClass application I guess I need some kind of object factory but it should be fairly simple since there s always only one type to create the default implementation or the user implementation Any idea about how to design a simple factory like I just described Consider the fact that there might be more classes in the future so it should be easy to extend I don t care if it happens more than once Edit Please note that there are more than two objects that are contained in TheManager,cpp
Every tutorial or explanation of REST just goes too complicated too quickly the learning curve rises so fast after the initial explanation of CRUD and the supposed simplicity over SOAP Why can t people write decent tutorials anymore I m looking at Restlet and its not the best there are things missing in the tutorial and the language grammar is a bit confusing and unclear It has took me hours to untangle their First Steps tutorial with the help of another Java programmer RESTlet Tutorial Comments Overall I m not sure exactly who the tutorial was aimed at because there is a fair degree of assumed knowledge all round so coming into REST and Restlet framework cold leaves you with a lot of catchup work to do and re reading paragraphs over and over again We had difficulty working out that the jars had to be in copied into the correct lib folder Problems with web xml creating a HTTP Status 500 error The server encountered an internal error that prevented it from fulfilling this request the tutorial says Create a new Servlet Web application as usual add a com firstStepsServlet package and put the resource and application classes in This means that your fully qualified name for your class FirstStepsApplication is com firstStepsServlet FirstStepsApplication so we had to alter web xml to refer to the correct class e g original lt param value gt firstStepsServlet FirstStepsApplication lt param value gt should be lt param value gt com firstStepsServlet FirstStepsApplication lt param value gt Conclusion I was under the impression that the concepts of REST were supposed to be much simpler than SOAP but it seems just as bad if not more complicated don t get it at all grrrr Any good links much appreciated,java
I m trying to work out a way of passing the web current http context to a service class or initialising the class with a reference to it I am doing this to abstract the rest of the app away from needing to know anything about the http context I also want the service to be testable using TDD probably using one of the Mockable frameworks Hence it would be preferable to use an interface rather than an actual class An example of what I d like to achieve class WebInstanceService private IHttpContext _Context public WebInstanceService IHttpContext HttpContext _Context HttpContext Methods public string GetInstanceVariable string VariableName return _Context Current Session VariableName One of the main issues I have is that there is no IHttpContext the net http context is a subclass of an abstract class which can t be mocked easily Another issue is that I can t initialise global instances of the class as then the context won t be relevant for most requests I could make the class static and require the Context to be passed to each function as it is called i e public static string GetInstanceVariable string VariableName HttpContext Context but this doesn t make the class any easier to test I still need to create an HttpContext and additionally any non web aware services which want to use this class suddenly need to be able to retrieve the Context requiring them to be closely coupled to the web server the whole reason for wanting to create this class in the first place I m open to ALL suggestions particularly those which people know facilitate easy tdd testing How would people suggest I tackle this problem Cheers,csharp

Are there any good resources for porting a VB NET winforms application to C I m sure there are is software that just translates the code but I m looking to refactor the code at the same time Keeping it in its current form is problematic since it uses some of the bad design practices that VB NET allows and would further complicate future maintanence Has anyone here gone through that process and how did you go about doing it Did you use a translate refactor approach Did you just use the end product to recreate functionality without looking at the current codebase for most of it What would you collectively recommend Update As I was telling Grauenwolf keeping it in its current language presents the following issues Not being able to readily add features VB NET isn t a language I m rock solid in I do appreciate the irony of learning the language to port it over but future maintenance will need to account for someone who doesn t know VB NET The rest of the application has been ported to C a long time ago in fact all features that we d like to add depend on de coupling the app right now it s very tightly coupled My choices are to either refactor it in a language I m not too familiar with or to refactor it in a language I understand To anyone who voted the question down I m not really sure why you did the concern isn t whether I should leave it in VB NET the concern is what is the future cost of not porting it over now If I m going to spare great expense in fixing it why not go the extra step and make it maintainable for a future programmer Author s Note I hadn t looked at this question in ages there was a recent response so I moved my answer into the question and deleted the answer since it wasn t really an answer,csharp
We have a C library that we provide to several different clients Recently we made the switch from using raw pointers in the public interface to using boost sharedptr instead This has provided an enormous benefit as you might guess in that now the clients no longer have to worry about who needs to delete what and when When we made the switch I believed it was the right thing to do but it bothered me that we had to include something from a third party library in our public interface generally you avoid that kind of thing if you can I rationalized it that boost was practically part of the C language now and our use case requires that both the client code and the library hold pointers to the objects However recently one of our clients has asked us if we could switch to using a neutral smart pointer class in the interface because our library is essentially forcing them to a particular version of boost a point which I certainly understand and appreciate So now I am wondering what the best course of action might be I have thought about it a little bit and wondered about creating a simple smart pointer class that simply held a real boost smart pointer But then the clients would probably immediately stuff one of those into their flavor of boost sharedptr and then we d be three shared pointers deep which might be a problem or it might not Anyway I d love to hear some opinions from the community about the best way to solve this problem Edit I originally said transfer of ownership but I should have specified that code on both sides of the API boundary need to hold a pointer to the object,cpp
When using DataSources in ASP net applications paging and sorting along with GridView only works out of the box when using DataSet DataTable DataViews if you are using anything else you need to implement methods that perform paging as well as partial data retrieval from the datasource I dont know many design nowadays that pass around DataSets accross layers I am a big POCO fan and I like to keep things simple specially when working with DataContracts in WCF Am I missing something or is it too much to expect paging and sorting working out of the box or is it guys at MS dont think its important Is the DataPager control the answer Also I would really appreciate if someone can give me a fully functional gridview object data source Paging amp sorting tutorial link The ones I saw online made me feel that you need to hack your way in order to make it work,csharp

EDIT I ve tagged this C in a hope to get more response It s more the theory I m interested in than a specific language implementation So if you re a C coder please treat the following PHP as pseudo code and feel free to respond with an answer written in C I am trying to speed up a PHP CLI script by having it execute its tasks in parallel instead of serial The tasks are completely independent of each other so it doesn t matter which order they start finish in Here s the original script note all these examples are stripped back for clarity lt php items range 0 100 function do_stuff_with item echo item n foreach items as item do_stuff_with item I ve managed to make it work on the items in parallel with pcntl_fork as shown below lt php ini_set max_execution_time 0 ini_set max_input_time 0 set_time_limit 0 items range 0 100 function do_stuff_with item echo item n pids array foreach items as item pid pcntl_fork if pid 1 die couldn t fork elseif pid gt 0 parent pids pid else child do_stuff_with item exit 0 foreach pids as pid pcntl_waitpid pid status Now I want to extend this so there s a maximum of say 10 children active at once What s the best way of handling this I ve tried a few things but haven t had much luck,php

I m using a table adapter in Visual Studio to make a query to a stored procedure in my SQL Server 2005 database When I make the call via my website application it returns nothing When I make the same call via SQL Server Manager it returns the expected data I put a breakpoint on the call to the adapter s getData method and looked at all the parameters and their values and matched them in a query from server management to make sure I m sending the following query getData string date date int int int string int string further getData 0000 rtg 1 1 2007 3 12 2008 0 null null null null null I guess I m wondering if Visual Studio does something with the null s before it tries to send the query to the SQL server If not how do I fix this problem EDIT All these values are passed by variables I just typed what was in those variables at that break point,csharp

Here s the scenario My users are presented a grid basically a stripped down version of a spreadsheet There are textboxes in each row in the grid When they change a value in a textbox I m performing validation on their input updating the collection that s driving the grid and redrawing the subtotals on the page This is all handled by the OnChange event of each textbox When they click the Save button I m using the button s OnClick event to perform some final validation on the amounts and then send their entire input to a web service saving it At least that s what happens if they tab through the form to the Submit button The problem is if they enter a value then immediately click the save button SaveForm starts executing before UserInputChanged completes a race condition My code does not use setTimeout but I m using it to simulate the sluggish UserInputChanged validation code lt snip gt lt script gt var amount null var currentControl null function UserInputChanged control currentControl control use setTimeout to simulate slow validation code production code does not use setTimeout setTimeout ValidateAmount 100 function SaveForm call web service to save value document getElementById SavedAmount innerHTML amount function ValidateAmount various validationey functions here amount currentControl value save value to collection document getElementById Subtotal innerHTML amount update subtotals lt script gt lt snip gt Amount lt input type text id UserInputValue onchange UserInputChanged this gt lt br gt Subtotal lt span id Subtotal gt lt span gt lt br gt lt input type button onclick SaveForm value Save gt lt br gt lt br gt Saved amount lt span id SavedAmount gt lt span gt lt snip gt I don t think I can speed up the validation code it s pretty lightweight but apparently slow enough that code tries to call the web service before the validation is complete On my machine 95ms is the magic number between whether the validation code executes before the save code begins This may be higher or lower depending on the users computer speed Does anyone have any ideas how to handle this condition A coworker suggested using a semaphore while the validation code is running and a busy loop in the save code to wait until the semaphore unlocks but I d like to avoid using any sort of busy loop in my code,javascript

Currently I have the function CreateLog for creating a a log4net Log with name after the constructing instance s class Typically used as in class MessageReceiver protected ILog Log Util CreateLog If we remove lots of error handling the implementation boils down to EDIT Please read the longer version of CreateLog further on in this post public ILog CreateLog System Diagnostics StackFrame stackFrame new System Diagnostics StackFrame 1 System Reflection MethodBase method stackFrame GetMethod return CreateLogWithName method DeclaringType FullName Problem is that if we inheirit MessageReceiver into sub classes the log will still take its name from MessageReceiver since this is the declaring class of the method constructor which calls CreateLog class IMReceiver MessageReceiver class EmailReceiver MessageReceiver Instances of both these classes would get Logs with name MessageReceiver while I would like them to be given names IMReceiver and EmailReceiver I know this can easily be done and is done by passing a reference to the object in creation when calling CreateLog since the GetType method on object does what I want There are some minor reasons to prefer not adding the parameter and personally I feel disturbed by not finding a solution with no extra argument Is there anyone who can show me how to implement a zero argument CreateLog that gets the name from the subclass and not the declaring class EDIT The CreateLog function does more than mentioned above The reason for having one log per instance is to be able to differ between different instances in the logfile This is enforced by the CreateLog CreateLogWithName pair Expanding on the functionality of CreateLog to motivate its existence public ILog CreateLog System Diagnostics StackFrame stackFrame new System Diagnostics StackFrame 1 System Reflection MethodBase method stackFrame GetMethod Type type method DeclaringType if method IsStatic return CreateLogWithName type FullName else return CreateLogWithName type FullName GetAndInstanceCountFor type Also I prefer writing ILog Log Util CreateLog rather than copying in some long cryptic line from an other file whenever I write a new class I am aware that the reflection used in Util CreateLog is not guaranteed to work though is System Reflection MethodBase GetCurrentMethod guaranteed to work,csharp

I have been banging my head on this one all day The C project I am currently working on has a requirement to display an editable value The currently selected digit displays the incremented value above and decremented value below for said digit It is useful to be able to reference the editable value as both a number and collection of digits What would be awesome is if there was some indexable form of a floating point number but I have been unable to find such a solution I am throwing this question out there to see if there is something obvious I am missing or if I should just roll my own Thanks for the advice I was hoping for a solution that wouldn t convert from float string int but I think that is the best way to get away from floating point quantization issues I ended up going with boost format and just referencing the individual characters of the string I can t see that being a huge performance difference compared to using combinations of modf and fmod to attempt to get a digit out of a float It probably does just that behind the scenes only more robustly than my implementation,cpp

Meta note I was browsing the question page getting really tired of DIVS vs Tables When to use tables vs DIVS Are Divs better than Tables Tables versus CSS and all the questions that ask THE SAME THING OMG PEOPLE but I would like to see all the ways people tackle the translation of the canonical example of why you should give up and use tables lt table gt lt tr gt lt td gt Name lt td gt lt td gt lt input gt lt td gt lt tr gt lt tr gt lt td gt Social Security Number lt td gt lt td gt lt input gt lt td gt lt tr gt lt table gt Question How to best semantically simply robustly fluidly portably implement the above without tables For starters I guess a naive implementation uses a fixed column width for the first column but that can have iffy results for dynamically generated content Including strengths weaknesses of your approach in the answer would be nice P S Another one I wonder about a lot is vertical centering but the hack for that is covered pretty well at jakpsatweb cz EDIT scunlife brings up a good example of why I didn t think out the problem that carefully Tables can align multiple columns simultaneously The Question still stands I d like to see different CSS techniques used for alignment layout although solutions that can handle his more involved example definitely are preferred,html

It seems it is general accepted that exception specifications are not helping as much as one thinks But I wonder if a specification which only uses std exception might be a good compromise void someFunction throw std exception It documents the fact that this method function might throw an exception It would make sure that only exceptions derived from std exception are thrown and not some exotic classes like std string or int So would this be better then not having any specification at all Update Regarding the Runtime Overhead Think of it like the usage of asserts You are using asserts regardless of the runtime overhead right I know you usually can disable them for a release build so maybe a better approach would be to wrap the exception specification in a macro so you can disable it for a release build Something like ifdef DEBUG define THROW exception throw exception else define THROW exception endif void someFunction THROW std exception,cpp

My team of which I am the newest and most junior member has increased in size from 3 to 9 developers in just about 1 year Our primary product has increased in complexity and we are about to undertake a year long port re write to Silverlight In the past there has been no specific style standard enforced I suggested to my boss that now would be a good time to implement such standards I passed on IDesign s document to him and he likes the idea He has 2 concerns This is a big document to absorb My thought here is to develop a slimmed down cheat sheet for the most common items that we re likely to run into with the understanding that the IDesign standard is the Master and anything not covered in the slimmed down version should be looked up in the Master document What is the best way to enforce this It s not a question of trying to dictate it s a matter of trying to get folks used to developing to a particular standard There are at least 2 folks on the team that have been developing to the current non standard for several years now In order to address this concern I d like to see if there s a tool that can be configured to enforce these standards or at a minimum warn of violations of the standard at either compile time or design time I found Microsoft d StyleCop but from what I ve been able to determine it isn t configurable and is set up to follow Microsoft s standard which doesn t completely mesh with IDesign s Any input on tools or the approach I m looking at would be appreciated,csharp

This one has us all baffled at work We have two services running on net 3 5 SP1 that hits up sharepoint and return Lists of model objects that are pretty similar One of them works fine the other throws an EngineExecutionException on the return I know that is sort of vague but everything executes fine right up until that point When you look at the List in the debugger everything looks pretty normal Has anyone had this happen before If so what did you do to work around it,csharp

Our logging class when initialised truncates the log file to 500 000 bytes From then on log statements are appended to the file We do this to keep disk usage low we re a commodity end user product Obviously keeping the first 500 000 bytes is not useful so we keep the last 500 000 bytes Our solution has some serious performance problem What is an efficient way to do this,cpp
I have a ticker which items are updated using polling I have written a simple jQuery plugin for the ticker which is invoked like so cont ul ticker Which turns a ul into a ticker scrolling through the li To add new items I have to add lis to the ul which works fine However the OO in me wishes I could have an addItem function on a ticker object However I don t want to lose the chainability that jQuery uses Is there some method which is more obvious than adding ul s to the list but that fit s with the jQuery way of doing things,javascript

We were having a debate if enums should have uninitialized values For example We have public enum TimeOfDayType Morning Afternoon Evening or public enum TimeOfDayType None Morning Afternoon Evening I think that there shouldn t be any none but then you have to default to some valid value on initialization But others thought there should be some indication of uniitized state by having another enum that is None or NotSet thoughts,csharp
Having read up on quite a few articles on Artificial Life A subject I find very interesting along with several questions right here on SO I ve begun to toy with the idea of designing a Very very very simple simulator No graphics required even If I ve overlooked a question please feel free to point it out to me Like I said this will hardly be a Sims level simulation I believe it will barely reach acceptable freeware level it is simply a learning exercise and something to keep my skills up during a break The basic premise is that a generic person is created No name height or anything like that Like I said simple the only real thing it will receive is a list of associations and generic use pick up and look abilities My first question is in regards to the associations What does SO recommend as an efficient way to handle such things I was thinking a multimap with the relatively easy set up of the key being what it wants Food eat rest et cetera and the other bit Sorry my mind has lapsed being what it associates with that need For example say we have a fridge The fridge contains food Just a generic base object Initially the person doesn t associate fridge with food but it does associate food with hunger So when its hunger grows it begins to arbitrarily look for food If no food is within reach it uses objects to find food Since it has no known associations with food it uses things willy nilly Probably looking for the nearest object and expanding out Once it uses opens the fridge it sees food making the connection Read inserting the pair food fridge that the fridge contains food Now I realise this will be far more complex than it appears and I m prepared to hammer it out The question is would a multimap be suitable for a Possibly exponentially expanding list of associations If not what would be The second question I have is probably far easier Simply put would a generic object item interface be suitable for most any item In other words would a generic use interface work for what I intend I don t think I m explaining this well Anyway any comments are appreciated,cpp

Okay I develop web applications in PHP and JavaScript and a lot of times here on Stack Overflow I have seen the word unit test passing by but nowhere on the website have I been able to found a satisfactory answer to what exactly a unit test is So what are unit tests and should I as a PHP and JavaScript programmer care or are they only for real programming languages,php

I m currently reworking our existing proprietary socket wrapper code to use boost asio so that it can do some of the heavy lifting for us Perhaps the most complex area of our existing code is the multicast handling code The code allows our middle tier servers of which there can me many in one system to send multicasts to client boxes which use these to present updates to the users of the system The reason the code is complex and error prone is that it uses a number of raw buffers to reassemble the multicast streams according to where they have come from It appears that even with Boost Asio I m going to have to deal with this same issue so before I get stuck in I thought it would be worth asking how other people have dealt with this situation It seems like a very common use case Is there anything out there that can help me do this job without the kind of code I have now Or is there an established C template Boost or otherwise that can do this kind of work Obviously I could make things easier on myself and use STL containers to buffer the packets instead of raw arrays but this code needs to be really high performance On large installs there are a huge number of packets flying around and it needs to respond as near to real time as possible Thanks in advance for any thoughts on this matter Jamie,cpp

Some issues with timezones in PHP have been in the back of my mind for a while now and I was wondering if there are better ways to handle it than what I m currently doing All of the issues revolve around reformating database stored dates When dealing with a site that has to support multiple timezones for users to normalize the timezone offest of stored timestamps I always store it with the server timezone using the CURRENT_TIMESTAMP attribute or the NOW function This way I don t have to consider what timezone was set for PHP when the timestamp was entered since PHP time functions are timezone aware For each user according to his preference I set the timezone somewhere in my bootstrap file using date_default_timezone_set timezone When I m looking to format dates with the php date function some form of conversion has to take place since MySQL currently stores timestamp in the format Y m d H i s With no regard to timezone you could simply run date date format strtotime dbTimestamp The problem with this is that date and strtotime are both timezone aware functions meaning that if the PHP timezone is set differently from the server timezone the timezone offset will apply twice instead of once as we would like To deal with this I usually retrieve MySQL timestamps using the UNIX_TIMESTAMP function which is not timezone aware allowing my to apply date directly on it thereby applying the timezone offset only once I don t really like this hack as I can no longer retrieve those columns as I normally would or use to fetch all columns sometimes it simplifies queries greatly Also sometimes it s simply not an option to use UNIX_TIMESTAMP especially when using with open source packages without much abstraction for query composition Another issue is when storing the timestamp when usage of CURRENT_TIMESTAMP or NOW is not an option storing a PHP generated timestamp will store it with the timezone offset which I would like to avoid I m probably missing something really basic here but so far I haven t been able to come up with a generic solution to handle those issues so I m forced to treat them case by case Your thoughts are very welcome,php
I have some flatpages with empty content field and their content inside the template given with template_name field Why I am using django contrib flatpages It allows me to serve mostly static pages with minimal URL configuration I don t have to write views for each of them Why I don t need the model FlatPage I leave the content empty and just supply a template path Therefore I can take advantage of having the source in a file I can edit the source directly from the file system without the help of a server such as admin I can take advantage of syntax highlightning and other editor features With the model I have to maintain fixtures for flatpages So the data for the same entity is in two seperate places If I move the content inside the fixture it ll be more difficult to edit Even if fixture maintenance was a non issue I d still need to dump and load these fixtures again and again during development What I am looking for Basically getting rid of FlatPage model while maintaining contrib flatpages functionality I don t have a clear idea how this should be solved If there s a clean way of modifying like add_to_class FlatPages to get the information somewhere other than the database I d prefer that Maybe the metadata can be inserted to the templates and then a special manager that reads this data would replace the default manager of FlatPages If I don t prefer manual editing over admin functionality for flatpages how can take the database out of the equation,python

I currently am trying to write a Python program using scheme semantics so I can later translate it into Scheme without relying on a lot of Pythonic stuff I m trying solve the sliding puzzle problem where you have 9 slots and 8 tiles arranged in a square using a depth first and breadth first search algorithm I did this 11 years ago in some AI class in Lisp but basically at the time I had no idea about lisp I hated it with all my heart and only in retrospect do I realize I was programming C in Lisp The prof didn t help in this matter I have a python function which can swap two tiles easily def swap p r1 c1 r2 c2 Swaps any two locations and returns new configuration Does not concern itself with zero location etc Not sure how to do this functionally p_p p temp p_p r1 c1 p_p r1 c1 p_p r2 c2 p_p r2 c2 temp return p_p I d like to turn this into something you might find in SICP avoiding side effects etc But this brings up a question Everything I read in SICP is loops via recursion I didn t see anything in accessing arrays vectors lists in constant time I can imagine a loopish recursive way to read an element but I find it harder to imagine a way to create a new list with a certain element changed without invoking side effect producing things like set and without resorting to crazy if then else clauses concerning which element should be changed This of course gets more confusing when considering a 2d array In this case the solution with python is obvious because of its native support for multidimensional arrays In C C Python Matlab Lua anything else accessing lists arrays via the i syntax is easy and directly translates to a hardware oriented pointer lookup somewhere underneath I don t understand how scheme does this given the atomic operations defined in the SICP version of scheme which all seem very loop and search oriented How do the vector and list array access functions work to get constant time access I m a total newbie here so I m not ever sure what functions I d be talking about Is there a C or Assembly library someplace which is secretly being accessed Are there any inherent constant time semantics in scheme which could be used for list array vector access and which would allow me a guilt free way of using that idiom in Python for the moment How would can I rewrite the above function in python using Schemish semantics How would I rewrite the above function in Scheme,python

I am writing a Firefox extension I would like to search the current webpage for a set of words and count how many times each occurs This activity is only performed when the user asks but it must still happen reasonably quickly I am currently using indexOf on the BODY tag s innerHTML element but am finding it too slow to run repeatedly in the following manner function wordcount doc match var count 0 var pos 0 for len doc indexOf match pos if len 1 break pos len match length count return count var html content document body innerHTML toLowerCase for var i 0 i lt keywords length i var kw keywords i myDump kw wordcount html kw With 100 keywords this takes approximately 10 to 20 seconds to run There is some scope to reduce the number of keywords but it will still need to run much quicker Is there a more obvious way to do this What is the most efficient method I have some ideas but am reluctant to code each up without some idea of the performance I can expect Navigate the DOM rather than using innerHTML Will this be likely quicker or slower It would have the benefit of only searching textual content Loop through the document word by word accumulating a count of each word s occurence simultaneously With this method I would have to do a bit more work parsing the HTML Edit Turns out that the slowest part was the myDump function writing to the error console Duh Nevertheless there some interesting more efficient alternatives have been presented which I am intending to use,javascript

First of all I m not trying to be critical of anyone here or saying that all Net programmers are this way But I m definitely noticing a trend Net programmers seem to avoid exceptions like they re the plague Of course there s always the Raymond Chen blog post about how hard exceptions can be to handle But that doesn t just apply to Net In a lot of other languages environments I don t notice that programmers are as likely to avoid exceptions as they are in Net Heck in Python exceptions are thrown in normal program execution iterators throw StopIteration exceptions So what am I missing here Or am I totally off base in thinking that net programmers avoid exceptions more than others,csharp

I m in the process of extending and improving a website that has quite a few structural problems It looks very much like the developers before me had heard of MVC but didn t understand the ideas of abstraction or modularity So the MVC framework is a bespoke b broken c patched and d there are several in use all at once I intend to fix that This is not the first time I ve re built a site s framework BTW but it is the first time I ve had to fix an MVC framework However I m coming up against some missing holes in the MVC knowledge here on SO The first is how closely programmers seem to tie their SQL database with their models This doesn t make sense to me do programmers normally have the model looking after the data abstraction To me this is little better than putting SQL in raw PHP code Or is there a data access layer normally employed that Does SQL I know from experience that the latter means the calling code doesn t have to worry about where the data is or how to get it or how to write it the API handles that But what about the Models Are they intended to be re usable amongst different pages Should they care about just where the data is stored Shouldn t they be more concerned with handling the logic between data fetch and data show e g turning a contact s group ID into a displayable name And data save and data write e g figuring out how to turn _POST values into savable data Maybe the MVC model really be DMVC Data Model View Controller Lastly although this is from a PHP point of view how well do these concepts translate to a JSP site,java

I would like to create a simple file format DSL which would allow my users to input data My system is in python and using python s parser is appealing Syntax like this for defining a data element seems quite convenient Allocation Param1 Val1 Param2 Val2 However it does not support param names with spaces Allocation Param 1 Val1 Param 2 Val2 Python parser friendly versions can look as follows but not very user friendly Allocation Param 1 Val1 Param 2 Val1 Allocation Param 1 Val1 Param 2 Val1 Is there a way to make this more readable in python,python
In Windows when you press Alt and release it again the menu bar gets activated However when you press Alt then click then release the menu bar does not get activated because presumably you wanted to Alt click not activate the menu bar I want to support Alt mouse wheel changes which would map to horizontal scrolling This works fine but if you are ready and release the Alt key the menu bar activates Obviously this is not desirable There must be some kind of action that Windows does internally when you Alt click to cancel the internal ActivateMenuBarWhenAltIsReleased flag If I know what it is I can do this myself when I receive a mouse wheel message So does anyone know how the system works that activates the menu bar when you press and release Alt and how to cancel this Thanks,cpp

All the member variables and member functions in my class ClassA are static If a user is trying by mistake to create an object of this class he receives a warning ClassA local variable never referenced because all the functions are static so this object is never referenced So I want to prevent the user from trying to create an object of this class Would it be enough to create a private default no variables constructor Or do I have to also create private copy constructor and private assignment operator to prevent using the default constructors And if I do have to create them too maybe it would be better just to create some dummy pure virtual function instead and this will prevent the user from creating an object Thank you,cpp

What is the best way to store instances of a class to file database We have a base class called Command and loads of derived classes Users create instances of these classes by adding commands to a graphical designer where they can configure them Set the properties We then need a way to store these commands to a file without losing any information One idea was to use db4o but the GPL license is not acceptable for this project Any suggestions or code samples Update In order to de blurryfie my question p The generated code might look something like command i new DelayInSecondsCommand 2 command i new DaliRequestCommand 1 false 254 command i new DaliRequestCommand 2 false 254 command i new DaliRequestCommand 3 false 254 command i new WaitInSecondsCommand 2 command i new DaliRequestCommand 1 false 0 command i new DaliRequestCommand 2 false 0 command i new DaliRequestCommand 3 false 0 command i new JumpCommand 0 But then with loads of different commands I know it s possible with NET serialization altough I ve never used it before but I was wondering if there are better alternatives like I said db4o seems nice but the license doesn t fit the project Update 2 Thank you for the replies I ll probably go with the serialization solution now but I ll look into the other options as well F Y I data is stored in a SQL Compact database,csharp

I am developing a NET 2 0 WinForms utility that connects to a SQL Server 2005 database I have found reference material such as Avoiding Plaintext Passwords for handling the actual encryption of the connection string data I now need to implement the encryption during the installation process so that an administrator can install the utility on a user s desktop but not provide the user with the database connection information The sample code all seems geared toward performing the encrypting within the primary application So the app would need to be executed once for the encryption to take place If the application is installed but not executed the configuration information would be in plain text in the configuration file Can anyone provide information showing how the encryption can be performed from the setup app Other approaches to the problem are welcome as well however due to business requirements I am not in a position to require Windows authentication for the database connection I am limited to SQL Server authentication Edit I may have been overly brief with my description We have already performed a risk assessment and determined that using the built in NET framework functionality for encrypting the connection information provides sufficient security for the application We understand that a truly determined individual could eventually obtain the connection information and we readily accept that risk The purpose of encrypting the connection data is to simply raise the bar of effort and to help keep honest people honest Having already worked out the means of performing the encryption I am now trying to work out a method of performing the encryption from within the installation process Any help along those lines woul be appreciated Thanks,csharp
I would like to store my FreeMarker templates in a database table that looks something like template_name template_content hello Hello user goodbye So long user When a request is received for a template with a particular name this should cause a query to be executed which loads the relevant template content This template content together with the data model the value of the user variable in the examples above should then be passed to FreeMarker However the FreeMarker API seems to assume that each template name corresponds to a file of the same name within a particular directory of the filesystem Is there any way I can easily have my templates loaded from the DB instead of the filesystem EDIT I should have mentioned that I would like to be able to add templates to the database while the application is running so I can t simply load all templates at startup into a new StringTemplateLoader as suggested below Cheers Don,java

I ve been trying to find information on this but due to the immaturity of the Spring Integration framework I haven t had much luck Here is my desired work flow New files are placed in an Incoming directory Files are picked up using a file inbound channel adapter The file content is streamed N lines at a time to a Stage 1 channel which parses the line into an intermediary shared representation This parsed line is routed to multiple Stage 2 channels Each Stage 2 channel does its own processing on the N available lines to convert them to a final representation This channel must have a queue which ensures no Stage 2 channel is overwhelmed in the event that one channel processes significantly slower than the others The final representation of the N lines is written to a file There will be as many output files as there were routing destinations in step 4 N above stands for any reasonable number of lines to read at a time from 1 whatever I can fit into memory reasonably but is guaranteed to always be less than the number of lines in the full file How can I accomplish streaming steps 3 4 5 in Spring Integration It s fairly easy to do without streaming the files but my files are large enough that I cannot read the entire file into memory As a side note I have a working implementation of this work flow without Spring Integration but since we re using Spring Integration in other places in our project I d like to try it here to see how it performs and how the resulting code compares for length and clarity,java

My company has been evaluating Spring MVC to determine if we should use it in one of our next projects So far I love what I ve seen and right now I m taking a look at the Spring Security module to determine if it s something we can should use Our security requirements are pretty basic a user just needs to be able to provide a username and password to be able to access certain parts of the site such as to get info about their account and there are a handful of pages on the site FAQs Support etc where an anonymous user should be given access In the prototype I ve been creating I have been storing a LoginCredentials object which just contains username and password in Session for an authenticated user some of the controllers check to see if this object is in session to get a reference to the logged in username for example I m looking to replace this home grown logic with Spring Security instead which would have the nice benefit of removing any sort of how do we track logged in users and how do we authenticate users from my controller business code It seems like Spring Security provides a per thread context object to be able to access the username principal info from anywhere in your app Object principal SecurityContextHolder getContext getAuthentication getPrincipal which seems very un Spring like as this object is a global singleton in a way My question is this if this is the standard way to access information about the authenticated user in Spring Security what is the accepted way to inject an Authentication object into the SecurityContext so that it is available for my unit tests when the unit tests require an authenticated user Do I need to wire this up in the initialization method of each test case protected void setUp throws Exception SecurityContextHolder getContext setAuthentication new UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken testUser getLogin testUser getPassword This seems overly verbose Is there an easier way The SecurityContextHolder object itself seems very un Spring like,java

I have some unicode text that I want to clean up using regular expressions For example I have cases where u 2 This exists because for formatting reasons the closing paren ends up in an adjacent html cell My initial solution to this problem was to look ahead at the contents of the next cell and using a string function determine if it held the closing paren I knew this was not a great solution but it worked Now I want to fix it but I can t seem to make the regular expression work missingParen re compile r d My understanding of what I think I am doing at the beginning of the string I want to find an open paren the paren has to be backslashed because it is a special character d I also want to find a single digit I am creating a special character class I don t want to find what follows which is a close paren at the end of the string And of course the plot thickens I made a silly assumption that because I placed a d I would not find 33 but I am wrong so I added a 1 to my regular expression and that did not help it matched 3333 so my problem is more complicated than I thought I want the string to be only an open paren and a single digit Is this the more clever approach missingParen re compile r d And note S Lott _I already tagged it beginner so you can t pick up any cheap points Not that I don t appreciate your insights I keep meaning to read your book it probably has the answer,python

For years and years I ve tried to understand the part of Java specification that deals with memory model and concurrency I have to admit that I ve failed miserably Yes I understand about locks and synchronized and wait and notify And I can use them just fine thank you I even have a vague idea about what volatile does But all of that was not derived from the language spec rather from general experience Here are two sample questions that I am asking I am not so much interested in particular answers as I need to understand how the answers are derived from the spec or may be how I conclude that the spec has no answer What does volatile do exactly Are writes to variable atomic Does it depend on variable s type,java
My question is if an interface that is implemented implicitly by extending a class that already implements it should be explicitly implemented by the class if the class wants to advertise the fact that it fulfills the contract of that interface For instance if you want to write a class that fulfills the contract of the interface java util List You implement this extending the class java util AbstractList that already implements the interface List Do you explicitly declare that you implement List public class MyList extends AbstractList implements List Or do you save typing by using the implicit way public class MyList extends AbstractList Which way is considered better style What reasons do you have to prefer one way or another In which situations you would prefer way 1 or way 2,java

I have a circular dependency between two functions I would like each of these functions to reside in its own dll Is it possible to build this with visual studio foo int i if i gt 0 bar i i should compile into foo dll bar int i if i gt 0 foo i i should compile into bar dll I have created two projects in visual studio one for foo and one for bar By playing with the References and compiling a few times I managed to get the dll s that I want I would like to know however whether visual studio offers a way to do this in a clean way If foo changes bar does not need to be recompiled because I only depend on the signature of bar not on the implementation of bar If both dll s have the lib present I can recompile new functionality into either of the two and the whole system still works The reason I am trying this is that I have a legacy system with circular dependencies which is currently statically linked We want to move towards dll s for various reasons We don t want to wait until we clean up all the circular dependencies I was thinking about solutions and tried out some things with gcc on linux and there it is possible to do what I suggest So you can have two shared libraries that depend on each other and can be built independent of each other I know that circular dependencies are not a good thing to have but that is not the discussion I want to have,cpp

I have been investigating for some time now a way to prevent my user from accidently entering a data directory of my application My application uses a folder to store a structured project The folder internal structure is critic and should not be messed up I would like my user to see this folder as a whole and not be able to open it like a Mac bundle Is there a way to do that on Windows Edit from current answers Of course I am not trying to prevent my users from accessing their data just protecting them from accidentally destroying the data integrity So encryption or password protection are not needed Thank you all for your Net answers but unfortunately this is mainly a C project without any dependency to the Net framework The data I am mentioning are not light they are acquired images from an electronic microscope These data can be huge 100 MiB to 1 GiB so loading everything in memory is not an option These are huge images so the storage must provide a way to read the data incrementally by accessing one file at a time without loading the whole archive in memory Besides the application is mainly legacy with some components we are not even responsible of A solution that allows me to keep the current IO code is preferable Shell Extension looks interesting I will investigate the solution further LarryF can you elaborate on Filter Driver or DefineDOSDevice I am not familiar with these concepts,cpp

I m looking for ways to watch mouse and keyboard events on Windows Linux and Mac from Python My application is a time tracker I m not looking into the event I just record the time when it happens If there are no events for a certain time say 10 minutes I assume that the user has left and stop the current project When the user returns events come in again I wait a moment so this doesn t get triggered by the cleaning crew or your pets or an earthquake If the events persist over a longer period of time I assume that the user has returned and I pop up a small inactive window where she can choose to add the time interval to break the current project meeting etc or a different project I ve solved the keylogger for Windows using the pyHook On Linux I have found a solution but I don t like it I can watch all device nodes in etc input and update a timestamp somewhere in var or tmp every time I see an event There are two drawbacks 1 I can t tell whether the event if from the user who is running the time tracker and 2 this little program needs to be run as root not good On Mac I have no idea yet Questions Is there a better way to know whether the user is creating events than watching the event devices on Linux Any pointers how to do that on a Mac,python

First let me explain what I am doing I need to take an order which is split up into different databases and print out this very large order What I need from the orders is about 100 or so columns from different databases The way I was doing in was querying with a join and assigning all of the column values to a variable in my one large Order class This has started to become troublesome I am wondering of instead of having one class that is comprised of 100 or so members that make up the order Should I have just one class for every database I use and then work with that Let me add to this Basically is it better to map you objects to the original database tables or the result set Because I have my object mapped to the result set and not the individual tables,csharp

I m interested in how much up front validation people do in the Python they write Here are a few examples of simple functions def factorial num Computes the factorial of num def isPalindrome inputStr Tests to see if inputStr is the same backwards and forwards def sum nums Same as the built in sum computes the sum of all the numbers passed in How thoroughly do you check the input values before beginning computation and how do you do your checking Do you throw some kind of proprietary exception if input is faulty BadInputException defined in the same module for example Do you just start your calculation and figure it will throw an exception at some point if bad data was passed in asd to factorial for example When the passed in value is supposed to be a container do you check not only the container but all the values inside it What about situations like factorial where what s passed in might be convertible to an int e g a float but you might lose precision when doing so,python

Sometimes Eclipse comes up saying hey you should debug this line but doesn t actually close the program I can then continue to play big two and even go through the same events that caused the error the first time and get another error box to pop up The bug is simple I ll fix it I just want to know why some bugs are terminal and some are not What s the difference,java
As made clear in update 3 on this answer this notation var hash hash X does not actually hash the object X it actually just converts X to a string via toString if it s an object or some other built in conversions for various primitive types and then looks that string up without hashing it in hash Object equality is also not checked if two different objects have the same string conversion they will just overwrite each other Given this are there any efficient implementations of hashmaps in javascript For example the 2nd Google result of javascript hashmap yields an implementation which is O n for any operation Various other results ignore the fact that different objects with equivalent string representations overwrite each other,javascript

I am working on creating a asmx webservice to meet the specific needs of an integration environment and for the life of me I cannot figure out how to get one section of it to work The key is that the request WSDL needs to be something like the following Note I removed the soap envelope and namespace information lt methodOne gt lt myValue gt string lt myValue gt lt myDemoGroup gt lt myDemoGroupItem gt string lt myDemoGroupItem gt lt myDemoGroupItem2 gt string lt myDemoGroupItem2 gt lt myDemoGroup gt lt myComplexGroup gt lt mySubStructure gt lt subItem1 gt string lt subItem1 gt lt subItem2 gt string lt subItem2 gt lt mySubStructure gt lt myComplexGroup lt methodOne gt Now I know how to take care of most of this the method one tag is handled by the name of my parameter and then the items inside are simply elements in the class SO something like this gets everything except for MyComplexGroup Web Method public void MyWebMethod MyWebMethodRequest methodOne Do my stuff public class MyWebMethodRequest public string myValue get set public MyDemoGroupInfo myDemoGroup get set public class MyDemoGroupInfo public string myDemoGroupItem get set public string myDemoGroupItem2 get set The question is how to I define the myComplexGroup to allow the creation of multiple mySubStructure elements while still outputting all items to the WSDL If I continue on and do something like this public class MyComplexGroupInfo public List lt MySubStructureInfo gt mySubStructure get set public class MySubStructureInfo public string subItem1 get set public string subItem2 get set I can then add public MyComplexGroupInfo myComplexGroup get set to the object and I will get part of it but instead of listing subItem1 and subItem2 it simply says MySubStructureInfo with nil set to one How can I get around this,csharp
Finally I have a question to ask on Stack Overflow The main target is for Java but I believe it is mostly language agnostic if you don t have native assert you can always simulate it I work for a company selling a suite of softwares written in Java The code is old dating back to Java 1 3 at least and at some places it shows That s a large code base some 2 millions of lines so we can t refactor it all at once Recently we switched the latest versions from Java 1 4 syntax and JVM to Java 1 6 making conservative use of some new features like assert we used to use a DEBUG ASSERT macro I know assert has been introduced in 1 4 but we didn t used it before generics only typed collections foreach loop enums etc I am still a bit green about the use of assert although I have read a couple of articles on the topic Yet some usages I see leave me perplex hurting my common sense _ So I thought I should ask some questions to see if I am right to want to correct stuff or if it goes against common practices I am wordy so I bolded the questions for those liking to skim stuff For reference I have searched assert java in SO and found some interesting threads but apparently no exact duplicate How to avoid       null      statements in java and How much null checking is enough are quite relevant because lot of asserts we have just check if variable is null At some places in our code there are usages of the null object eg returning new String 0 but not always We have to live with that at least for maintenance of legacy code Some good answers also in Java assertions underused Oh and SO indicates with reason that When should I use Debug Assert question is related too nice feature to reduce duplicates First main issue which triggered my question today SubDocument aSubDoc documents GetAt i assert aSubDoc null if aSubDoc GetType GIS_DOC continue assert aSubDoc GetDoc null ContentsInfo ci ContentsInfo aSubDoc GetDoc Yes we use MS C C style code conventions And I even like it coming from same background So sue us First the assert form comes from conversion of DEBUG ASSERT calls I dislike the extra parentheses since assert is a language construct not no longer here a function call I dislike also return foo Next the asserts don t test here for invariants they are rather used as guards against bad values But as I understand it they are useless here the assert will throw an exception not even documented with a companion string and only if assertions are enabled So if we have ea option we just have an assertion thrown instead of the regular NullPointerException one That doesn t look like a paramount advantage since we catch unchecked exceptions at highest level anyway Am I right supposing we can get rid of them and live with that ie let Java raise such unckecked exception or of course test against null value if likely which is done in other places Side note should I have to assert in the above snippet I would do that against ci value not against the getter even if most getters are optimized inlined we cannot be sure so we should avoid calling it twice Somebody told in the last referenced thread that public methods should use tests against values of parameters usage of the public API and private methods should rely on asserts instead Good advice Now both kinds of methods must check another source of data external input Ie data coming from user from a database from some file or from the network for example In our code I see asserts against these values I always change these to real test so they act even with assertions disabled these are not invariants and must be properly handled I see only one possible exception where input is supposed constant for example a database table filled with constants used in relations program would break if this table is changed but corresponding code wasn t updated Do you see other exceptions Another relatively frequent use I see which seems OK in the default of a switch or at the end of a series of else if testing all possible values these cases date back before our use of enums there is often an assert false Unexpected value for stuff stuff Looks legitimate for me these cases shouldn t happen in production what do you think beyond the no switch use OO advices which are irrelevant here And finally are there any other useful use cases or annoying gotchas I missed here probably,java

I generally try and keep all related entities in the same repository The following are entities that have a relationship between the two marked with indentation User UserPreference So they make sense to go into a user repository However users are often linked to many different entities what would you do in the following example User UserPrefence Order Order Product Order has a relationship with both product and user but you wouldn t put functionality for all 4 entities in the same repository What do you do when you are dealing with the user entities and gathering order information You may need extra information about the product and often ORMs will offer the ability of lazy loading However if your product entity is in a separate repository to the user entity then surely this would cause a conflict between repositories,csharp

I entered this statement in JSLint var number new Number 3 And received the following message Do not use Number as a constructor Why is that The statement is creating a number object not a primitive value so I don t see why using new is a problem EDIT Thanks for all the responses They ve got me thinking further so I posted a follow up question here UPDATE Thanks again for all the responses They ve been very helpful I guess to sum up in JavaScript an Object type is not equal to another Object type even when they have the exact same value unless they are both the EXACT SAME object In other words in Matthew s example below n1 n2 is false because you are comparing two REFERENCES to two SEPARATE objects but n1 n1 is true because you are comparing references to the EXACT SAME object So while I now understand why using Number as a constructor can cause problems I found you can use the valueOf property when comparing Number objects In other words n1 valueOf n2 valueOf is true This is because you re comparing the return values of the valueOf FUNCTION not the REFERENCES to the objects themselves,javascript

Apologies for the long post but I wonder if I could get some more eyeballs on this before I submit a bug report to Sun JVM 6u11 O S Windows XP SP3 Hardware AMD Athlon 64 X2 4600 2 41GHz with 3 25 GB RAM I believe I have encountered a fault in the JVM where no thread is given a monitor In the following thread traces the monitor lt 0x12a8f9f8 gt was acquired by RelayedMessages 0000000001 which ended up waiting on it that thread was subsequently notified However even though all of the threads listed are contending for the monitor none are getting it I promise the thread dump is complete for every thread which refers to monitor lt 0x12a8f9f8 gt The dump was obtained using Java VisualVM three times over a period of 16 hours and shown to be consistent each time these threads were unchanged Does anyone disagree with my assessment that the JVM is failing to deliver the monitor to any of the eligible threads when it should deliver it to one of them RelayedMessages 0000000001 daemon prio 6

I think there must be something subtle going on here that I don t know about Consider the following public class Foo lt T gt private T a T new Object 5 public Foo Add some elements to a public T getA return a Suppose that your main method contains the following Foo lt Double gt f new Foo lt Double gt Double d f getA You will get a CastClassException with the message java lang Object cannot be cast to java lang Double Can anyone tell me why My understanding of ClassCastException is that it is thrown when you try to cast an object to a type that cannot be casted That is to a subclass of which it is not an instance to quote the documentation e g Object o new Double 3 Double d Double o Working cast String s String o ClassCastException And it seems I can do this If a was just a T instead of an array T we can get a and cast it without a problem Why do arrays break this Thanks,java
I notice that get set is not the c way as far as I can tell by looking at boost stl and even reading the writings of some of the top c experts Does anyone use get set in their c class design and can someone suggest a rule of thumb on where if at all this paradigm belongs in the c world It is obviously very popular in Java and imitated by c using Property syntactic sugar EDIT Well after reading more about this in one of the links provided in an answer below I came across at least one argument for keeping the accessors of a member field the same name as the member field Namely that you could simply expose the member field as public and instead make it an instance of a class and then overload the operator By using set get you d force clients to not only recompile but to actually change their code Not sure I love the idea seems a bit too fine grained to me but more details are here C Killed the Getter Setter,cpp

Sorry for not so discrptive title if someone wants to change it go ahead Also note I have already asked a question about this kind of thing but this one is more about how you would attack it because my attack just doesn t seem to feel right I am having a problem with building a string up to send to an OLE object in the correct order using the polymorphism method in the other question The OLE object can only take and receive a string so what I am doing is building a wrapper around all the common commands and providing a more NET feel for them The problem I ran into very fast was some of the commands that my wrapper had to send where very long and had optional bits which then suddenly turned a method that was only setting a name into a big string building method with if s just to set a name and of course this happens all over the place because there are a lot of commands Now in order to have a good wrapper I would like to be able to wrap up the string building process so that I move the string building logic away from the wrapper itself and into a builder object I tried to attack this by using polymorphism which works well when I have a builder object class designed just for building that one type of command string See other post for details Sorry for the long post I will cut to the chase now The main problem is that there is a lot of command strings that have to be built up which means more builder objects So I would really like to have a generic string builder that can build a string from any list of commands but the catch is they have to be in the correct order even if the user sets them in the wrong order How would you approach this,csharp

As usual when my brain s messing with something I can t figure out myself I come to you guys for help This time I ve been wondering why stdafx h works the way it does To my understanding it does 2 things Includes standard headers which we might use and which are rarely changed Work as a compiler bookmark for when code is no longer precompiled Now these 2 things seems like two very different tasks to me and I wonder why they didn t do two seperate steps to take care of them To me it seems reasonable to have a pragma command do the bookmarking stuff and to optionally have a header file a long the lines of windows h to do the including of often used headers Which brings me to my next point Why are we forced to include often used headers through stdafx h Personally I m not aware of any often used headers I use that I m not already doing my own includes for but maybe these headers are necessary for dll generation Thx in advance,cpp

We have a ftp system setup to monitor download from remote ftp servers that are not under our control The script connects to the remote ftp and grabs the file names of files on the server we then check to see if its something that has already been downloaded If it hasn t been downloaded then we download the file and add it to the list We recently ran into an issue where someone on the remote ftp side will copy in a massive single file 1GB then the script will wake up see a new file and begin downloading the file that is being copied in What is the best way to check this I was thinking of grabbing the file size waiting a few seconds checking the file size again and see if it has increased if it hasn t then we download it But since time is of the concern we can t wait a few seconds for every single file set and see if it s file size has increased What would be the best way to go about this currently everything is done via pythons ftplib how can we do this aside from using the aforementioned method Yet again let me reiterate this we have 0 control over the remote ftp sites Thanks UPDATE1 I was thinking what if i tried to rename it since we have full permissions on the ftp if the file upload is in progress would the rename command fail We don t have any real options here do we UPDATE2 Well here s something interesting some of the ftps we tested on appear to automatically allocate the space once the transfer starts E g If i transfer a 200mb file to the ftp server While the transfer is active if i connect to the ftp server and do a size while the upload is happening It shows 200mb for the size Even though the file is only like 10 complete Permissions also seem to be randomly set the FTP Server that comes with IIS sets the permissions AFTER the file is finished copying While some of the other older ftp servers set it as soon as you send the file,python

I have a set of five boolean values If more than one of these are true I want to excecute a particular function What is the most elegant way you can think of that would allow me to check this condition in a single if statement Target language is C but I m interested in solutions in other languages as well as long as we re not talking about specific built in functions One interesting option is to store the booleans in a byte do a right shift and compare with the original byte Something like if myByte amp amp myByte gt gt 1 But this would require converting the separate booleans to a byte via a bitArray and that seems a bit pun intended clumsy edit Sorry that should have been if myByte amp myByte 1 edit Note This is of course very close to the classical population count sideways addition or Hamming weight programming problem but not quite the same I don t need to know how many of the bits are set only if it is more than one My hope is that there is a much simpler way to accomplish this,csharp

So I have an API that I need to implement in to an existing framework This API manages interactions with an external server I ve been charged with coming up with a way to create an easily repeatable pattern so that if people are working on new projects in the given framework they have a simple solution for integrating the API My first idea was to create a class for your main class of the framework to extend that would provide all the virtual functions necessary to interact with the API However my boss vetoed this since the existing framework is inheritence heavy and he wants to avoid adding to the madness I obviously can t incapsulate my API because that is what the API itself is supposed to be doing and doing so might hide functionality Short of asking futures developers to copy and paste my example what do I do,cpp

Given a variable foo of type FooClass and a member variable in that class named bar is the distance between foo and amp foo gt bar the same in any situation with some constraints FooClass is a non POD type We know that foo will always point to an instance of FooClass and not some subtype of it We only care about behaviour under a single compiler and a single compilation that is the value this may result in under gcc is never used in code compiled with MSVC and it is never saved to be re used between compilations It is computed in the binary and used in the binary and that is it We don t use a custom new although some instances of the class may be stack allocated and some heap allocated There is no explicit ctor for FooClass it relies upon the compiler generated one and each of the fields in FooClass is either POD or default constructable I can t find a guarantee either way on this in the standard nor did I expect to but my rudimentary testing with gcc leads me to believe that it will always be the case there I also know that this guarantee is made for POD types but let us assume this type can t be POD An update clarification this is just for a single compilation of a single binary the calculated offsets will never leave that single execution Basically I want to be able to uniquely identify the fields of a class in a static map and then be able to lookup into that map for some macro template EVIL trickery It is merely for my own amusement and no life support machines will rely on this code,cpp

I am trying to use Python s ctypes library to access some methods in the scanning library SANE This is my first experience with ctypes and the first time I have had to deal with C datatypes in over a year so there is a fair learning curve here but I think even without that this particular declaration would be troublesome extern SANE_Status sane_get_devices const SANE_Device device_list SANE_Bool local_only First of all I ve successfully dealt with SANE_Status an enum and SANE_Bool a typedef to c_int Those were both simple That first parameter on the other hand is causing me all sorts of grief I m unfamiliar with the notation to begin with and my tracer bullets so far have yielded nothing more than garbage data How do I format the input to this function such that I can read back a list of my Python structure objects For reference the C structure being referenced is typedef struct SANE_String_Const name unique device name SANE_String_Const vendor device vendor string SANE_String_Const model device model name SANE_String_Const type device type e g flatbed scanner SANE_Device Where SANE_String_Const is defined as a c_char_p My Python ctypes version of this object is class SANE_Device Structure _fields_ name c_char_p vendor c_char_p model c_char_p type c_char_p Suggestions on what I should pass in such that I can get the expected behavior a list of structure objects out of this All responses appreciated Update 1 Using the following I was able to retrieve a correct SANE_Device Python structure devices pointer pointer pointer SANE_Device status libsane sane_get_devices devices c_int 0 print status devices devices contents contents contents name However 1 yuck and 2 that seems like it would only work if there is a single result I can t len on devices contents contents or devices contents contents contents How am I to determine the number of results The SANE docs specify that If the function executes successfully it stores a pointer to a NULL terminated array of pointers to SANE_Device structures in device_list Suggestions Update 2 I was able to pass an ten item array and then access the first element using devices pointer pointer pointer SANE_Device 10 status libsane sane_get_devices devices c_int 0 print status devices devices contents contents contents 0 name However ten is obviously an arbitrary number and I have no way of determining the actual number of results Trying to access devices contents contents contents 1 name when only one device is connected causes a segmentation fault There must be a proper way of dealing with variable length constructs like these in ctypes,python

We have a large Java application that run as applet or Java Web Start And it grow more and more Typical a user need only a small part of the classes Because Java does not know which class can it found in which jar file that it load all jar files until it find the class If it will load a class that not exist for example a resource bundle then it load all jar files This reduce the start time on a small bandwidth very large Is there a small framework with which we can load the plugins only if needed Or better if needed and on background Of course the framework should not delay the start time self with it large size I think it should use a URLClassLoader for downloading,java
What is the easiest way in Java to map strings Java String to positive integers Java int so that equal strings map to equal integers and different strings map to different integers So similar to hashCode but different strings are required to produce different integers So in a sense it would be a hasCode without the collision possibility An obvious solution would maintain a mapping table from strings to integers and a counter to guarantee that new strings are assigned a new integer I m just wondering how is this problem usually solved Would also be interesting to extend it to other objects than strings,java

As an exercise I m translating parts of our large and battle hardened Delphi framework to C Included in this framework is a generic singleton parent class Of course implementing a singleton in C is fairly easy there is even a Jon Skeet article so what more could I wish for but our Delphi singleton has a slightly different take on the pattern as opposed to publishing an instance property method it has a fake constructor that always returns the same instance The essential characteristic of this approach is that the user of the singleton class doesn t know that he is dealing with a singleton as far as they know they just construct any old class and request some information from it I want to accomplish the same thing in C as an exercise so it doesn t have to be production quality code evil hackery is fine but so far I ve failed Any suggestion to make a simple myInstance new MyClass always return the same instance is most welcome Additional info We are talking a convenience implementation of the singleton pattern as offered by the framework It doesn t necessarely have to be a parent class but it does have to assist the developers in creating their own singletons as well Requiring them to manually redirect all their method calls to the single instance will not make them overflow with joy I m not really interested in debating whether or not this is the right way to deal with singletons for now I m just interested in the finer art of c tweaking,csharp
Is there a way to specify some JavaScript to execute on the OnBlur event of an ASP NET text box It seems to me like if I add any event handlers to the TextBox object they will just cause postbacks to the server isntead of doing what I want Basically I just want to be able to have the textbox be rendered in this HTML lt INPUT type text onblur alert 1234 gt Thanks,javascript
I know the question title isn t the best Let me explain I do a TON of text processing which converts natural language to xml These text files get uploaded fairly fast and thrown into a queue From there they are pulled one by one into a background worker that calls our parser using boost spirit to transform the text into xml and load relevant portions into our db The parser can do about 100 of these at a time I have rate limiters on the background worker to only poll our queue every so often right now so it doesn t perform as fast I can t throw up more than one background worker right now because my http requests start to drop the background worker and the webserver exist on the same machine and I believe it is because of cpu usage hitting 80 95 although we could use more ram on it as well I need to scale this better How would you go about doing it In answers to several questions we use amazon web services so buying cheap extra hardware is a bit different from spawning a new amazon instance maybe somebody has done some code that autospawns instances on amount of load we do have a http server that just stuffs our files into a queue so the only reason it would be affected is because the cpu is busy dealing with tons of parsing related stuff I already rate limit our background workers although we don t utilize that in the parser itself I haven t tried nice yet but I ve used it in the past I need to write down some benchmarks on that the parser is completely seperate from the web server we have nginx merb as our web application server and a rake task calling c as our background worker yet they do exist on the same machine,cpp
I have here a piece of PHP code that deletes a directory and all files in it if present However I m not too sure about it it looks to me like it ll delete all sub maps too and then files in those and so on I basically want to give and optional true false parameter to select wheter or not to delete sub directories Or would it be better practice to make 2 functions The first to completely empty the folder and the seconds the delete both the folder and everything in it Here s the code function delete_directory dirname if is_dir dirname dir_handle opendir dirname if dir_handle return false while file readdir dir_handle if file amp amp file if is_dir dirname file unlink dirname file else delete_directory dirname file closedir dir_handle rmdir dirname or die Could not remove directory return true And what I m basically wondering is what can go wrong here Is there a situation where this piece of code can seriously screw up I ve been debugging it with Netbeans for a few hours now and tried a lot of different scenarios Now I m kinda stuck and wondering if the guys at StackoverFlow can find a flaw in the code,php

I have some code in MS VC 6 0 that I am debugging For some reason at this certain point where I am trying to delete some dynamically allocated memory it breaks and I get a pop up message box saying User Breakpoint called from code at blah blah then the Disassembly window pops up and I see memory address int 3 The odd thing is there is NOWHERE in the code that I am calling an assembly instruction like this I think asm int 3 is a hardware break command for x86 what could be causing this EDIT ANSWER My code was walking off the end of an array but only in the locations marked by Visual Studio debug with 0xFDFDFDFD which is called a NoMan sLand fence I think its also called an Off by one error This array was unrelated to the point where i was freeing the memory when the error was occuring Which made it harder to spot,cpp

In win32 how do I setup a callback mechanism for RichEdit I have not created myself PART 1 I m reading from a textedit field in another application s GUI This works just fine now except after the first read I d like to fetch only new or modified lines In GTK or Qt I d just install a callback on some signal the field edits when its changed but how does it work on Win32 My MSDN searches result with nothing useful probably because I don t know the exact term to search for The class of the textedit is RichText20W and it has some messages that are probably used somehow though that article just discusses using them for the parent of the class PART 2 Also if there is no such text changed here is the newly inserted text callback which returns the new content immediately I need some way to easily detect what is new From top of my head Have a marker at the end of the text block we ve read and only read between that and the end Store what we ve read previously and after a second read remove the duplicate part from the latter to have the newly inserted stuff Option 2 might not be viable since the textedit can contain any amount of text The marker part sounds doable but yet again my feeble Win32 skills and horrible Win32 function names prevent me from finding the right way to do it Note that all these must be doable for a textedit I do not own and have not created they belong to a third party process Code samples in C highly appreciated Disclaimer Obviously if there is some better way of doing it let me know I only assumed callback would be the way to go based on my previous experience with GTK Qt Feel free to show me the path,cpp

I ve done quite a bit of programming on Windows but now I have to write my first Linux app I need to talk to a hardware device using UDP I have to send 60 packets a second with a size of 40 bytes If I send less than 60 packets within 1 second bad things will happen The data for the packets may take a while to generate But if the data isn t ready to send out on the wire it s ok to send the same data that was sent out last time The computer is a command line only setup and will only run this program I don t know much about Linux so I was hoping to get a general idea how you might set up an app to meet these requirements I was hoping for an answer like Make 2 threads one for sending packets and the other for the calculations But I m not sure it s that simple maybe it is Maybe it would be more reliable to make some sort of daemon that just sent out packets from shared memory or something and then have another app do the calculations If it is some multiple process solution what communication mechanism would you recommend Is there some way I can give my app more priority than normal or something similar PS The more bulletproof the better,cpp

After reading some threads on misuses of exceptions basically saying you don t want to unwind the stack if a functions preconditions are incorrect possibly signalling that all your memory is corrupt or something equally dangerous I m thinking about using assert more often Previously I have only used assert as a debug tool and I think this is how a lot of C programmers use it I m concerned about part of my error handling being turned off by a NDEBUG define introduced to the runtime builds at some point in the future Is there a way round this and have others had a problem with this i e should I be worrying about it Thanks Pat Edit The point of the threads I was reading was that if your application is truely buggered then unwinding stack could damage the system for instance if a destructor wrote something to a file and the file handle was corrupted I m not suggesting using assert for normal error handling The current use case I have is pretty weak but see what you think check later code won t crash the system if buf length 2 return false do other stuff that shouldn t affect bufs length copy 2 bytes into buf at a time if length is odd then don t know what will happen so use assert to make sure it can t damage anything assert buf length 2 for i 0 i buf length i 2 memcpy buf i data 2 edit2 the discussion is here http groups google com group comp lang c moderated browse_frm thread 80083ac31a1188da,cpp

I am using hudson CI to manage a straight java web project using ant to build I would like to mandate that the unit test coverage never be worse than the previous build thereby making sure any new code is always tested or at least the coverage is continually improving Is there a hudson plugin that works this way Edit I am currently using Emma but would be willing to switch to another coverage app Also as a clarification I ve seen the thresholds in some Hudson plugins but that s not exactly what I m after For example what I d like is that if coverage for Build 12 was 46 overall and someone checked in Build 13 with 45 coverage the build would break The reason I want to do this is that I have a codebase with low test coverage We don t have time to go back and retroactively write unit tests but I d like to make sure that the coverage keeps getting better UPDATE Dan pointed out an edge case with my plan that will definitely be a problem I think I need to rethink whether this is even a good idea,java
I have a simple task of authenticating against Active Directory using Java Just verifying credentials and nothing else Let s say my domain is fun xyz tld OU path is unknown and username password is testu testp I know there s a few Java libraries out there that simplify this task but I wasn t successful at implementing them Most examples that I ve found addressed LDAP in general not specifically Active Directory Issuing LDAP request means sending an OU path in it which I don t have Also the application that issues LDAP request should be already bound to Active Directory in order to access it Insecure since the credentials would have to be stored someplace discoverable I would like a test bind with test credentials if possible this would mean that account is valid Last if possible is there a way to make such authentication mechanism encrypted I know that AD uses Kerberos but not sure if Java s LDAP methods do Does anyone has an example of working code Thanks,java
When writing custom classes it is often important to allow equivalence by means of the and operators In Python this is made possible by implementing the __eq__ and __ne__ special methods respectively The easiest way I ve found to do this is the following method class Foo def __init__ self item self item item def __eq__ self other if isinstance other self __class__ return self __dict__ other __dict__ else return False def __ne__ self other return not self __eq__ other Do you know of more elegant means of doing this Do you know of any particular disadvantages to using the above method of comparing __dict__s Note A bit of clarification when __eq__ and __ne__ are undefined you ll find this behavior gt gt gt a Foo 1 gt gt gt b Foo 1 gt gt gt a is b False gt gt gt a b False That is a b evaluates to False because it really runs a is b a test of identity i e Is a the same object as b When __eq__ and __ne__ are defined you ll find this behavior which is the one we re after gt gt gt a Foo 1 gt gt gt b Foo 1 gt gt gt a is b False gt gt gt a b True,python

According to the documentation of the operator in MSDN For predefined value types the equality operator returns true if the values of its operands are equal false otherwise For reference types other than string returns true if its two operands refer to the same object For the string type compares the values of the strings User defined value types can overload the operator see operator So can user defined reference types although by default behaves as described above for both predefined and user defined reference types So why does this code snippet fail to compile void Compare lt T gt T x T y return x y I get the error Operator cannot be applied to operands of type T and T I wonder why since as far as I understand the operator is predefined for all types Edit Thanks everybody I didn t notice at first that the statement was about reference types only I also thought that bit by bit comparison is provided for all value types which I now know is not correct But in case I m using a reference type would the the operator use the predefined reference comparison or would it use the overloaded version of the operator if a type defined one Edit 2 Through trial and error we learned that the operator will use the predefined reference comparison when using an unrestricted generic type Actually the compiler will use the best method it can find for the restricted type argument but will look no further For example the code below will always print true even when Test test lt B gt new B new B is called class A public static bool operator A x A y return true class B A public static bool operator B x B y return false class Test void test lt T gt T a T b where T A Console WriteLine a b,csharp
I m trying to open a Microsoft Excel file in a C program using the excelApp Workbooks Open method As it happens if the format of the file is invalid this method causes an error message box to be displayed I however don t want that I wish to handle this error gracefully in my own code My question is how do I do that The above method doesn t throw any exception which I can catch Even if it did there s still that pesky message box anyway So perhaps the only way would be to validate the file format before opening it Is there then another method in Excel API to allow such validation,csharp

I been doing some inheritance in js in order to understand it better and I found something that confuses me I know that when you call an constructor function with the new keyword you get a new object with a reference to that function s prototype I also know that in order to make prototypal inheritance you must replace the prototype of the constructor function with an instance of the object you want to be the superclass So I did this silly example to try these concepts function Animal function Dog Animal prototype run function alert running Dog prototype new Animal Dog prototype bark function alert arf var fido new Dog fido bark ok fido run ok console log Dog prototype its an Object console log fido prototype UNDEFINED console log fido constructor prototype Dog prototype this is true function KillerDog KillerDog prototype deathBite function alert AAARFFF bite fido prototype new KillerDog console log fido prototype no longer UNDEFINED fido deathBite but this doesn t work This was done in Firebug s console 1 Why if all new objects contain a reference to the creator function s prototype fido prototype is undefined 2 Is the inheritance chain obj constructor prototype instead of obj prototype 3 is the prototype property of our object fido ever checked if so why is deathBite undefined in the last part Thanks,javascript

I have a friend who likes to use metaclasses and regularly offers them as a solution I am of the mind that you almost never need to use metaclasses Why because I figure if you are doing something like that to a class you should probably be doing it to an object And a small redesign refactor is in order Being able to use metaclasses has caused a lot of people in a lot of places to use classes as some kind of second rate object which just seems disastrous to me Is programming to be replaced by meta programming The addition of class decorators has unfortunately made it even more acceptable So please I am desperate to know your valid concrete use cases for metaclasses in Python Or to be enlightened as to why mutating classes is better than mutating objects sometimes I will start Sometimes when using a third party library it is useful to be able to mutate the class in a certain way this is the only case I can think of and it s not concrete,python

My team at work is considering to use a framework for developing web sites and applications Some of the seniors are convinced we should use the Zend Framework because it is easier to pick and choose the features so the framework we will be light weight I m afraid however that they are only looking at the technical advantages that a lightweight framework will have In my opinion it is better to have a full stack framework and I am a proponent of Symfony because It will also provide us with a standard way of working without writing new documentation If we would like to use new features we would only have to read the documentation to see how it can be used instead of having to build it into our setup of Zend first I don t expect all my questions to be answered by everybody but this is what I am looking for in the answer Do I have a point here Have you been in a similar situation and how did you handle that Do you have more arguments that I could use OR could make me reconsider my own opinion The context I work at a small shop with about 10 programmers We mostly program PHP We use a really simple inhouse developed framework and ORM library that are practically undocumented and lack anything but the most basic features no validators no transactions no caching no authentication,php
I m trying to add a CSS class to the Control that will get the focus once a page is rendered While the SetFocus method of the Page class lets me set the Control there is no corresponding GetFocus method According to the Net sources the information is stored in the private member _focusedControl of the Page class The property FocusedControl is marked internal Is there a way to get the value of the private member or internal property by using Reflection Any help would be greatly appreciated Clarification Here is why I want to add a CssClass server side I m trying to apply the following JQuery script that changes the background of the focused element document ready function var elements jQuery textarea select multi select text password file elements bind focus function jQuery this addClass highlightinput elements bind blur function jQuery this removeClass highlightinput This works fine as long as I don t specifically set a focused control in my aspx vb If I do set a focused control I think due to a timing issue the focus is set before my handlers are attached to the input fields and thus the input is not highlighted So my approach would be to add the highlightinput class to the focused control before rendering the page,jquery

I developed in ASP NET 2 0 for some time and for slightly less time in Java Spring Hibernate Right now I start developing new web service and am confused with the choice of NET WCF 3 5 versus Java Metro From one side WCF seems like a brilliantly developed solution a masterpiece of software frameworks with all the support for functional languages easy wizards simple architecture The downside is that it seems to be running on Windows only Mono doesn t support WCF and doesn t integrate so beautifully with Ruby on Rails through JRuby as Java does And Java seems really outdated no operator overloading or generic arrays So my main question is would anyone here start a new project using Java or is it just a dying language for legacy software PS Both performance and database connectivity are major priorities so that leaves slow Perl Ruby or Python and database unfriendly C out of the question PPS For presentation layer I m using Ruby on Rails,java

In the python program I m writing I ve got a thread which iterates over a large structure in memory and writes it incrementally into a file like object I ve got another thread which takes a file like object and writes it to disk Is there an easy way to connect the two such that any data input from the first thread will be buffered for the second Specifically I m trying to pass data to subprocess Popen The process will read from stdin but you cannot pass a file like object to Popen because it calls stdin fileno and blows up unless you have a real file Instead you need to pass the PIPE argument to Popen which allows you to use proc stdin as a file like object But if you ve already got a file like object there doesn t seem to be a great way to yolk the two of them together,python

I work at a small LAMP Development Studio where the idea has been to just get the code done and go on to the next item on the list The team works in Zend Studio 5 5 connected to the Live server via FTP or SFTP What they love about this is the speed of their deployment of code since its just modifying live code But of course this is not good due to many obvious reasons I would like to move them to a Versioning System CVS SVN or any other tool but the catch is I am not their senior so I need a carrot for them to start using this What kind of setup would I need to build on their machine so they can code along as usual What I would do is create this setup on my machine and then show them I know this is kinda unusual but it s turned into a passion of mine to change their way of thinking from the usual hacking of code to structure and elegance Thanks UPDATE for Jonathan Leffler s answer Yes No Yes they really do Question also the studio makes a centralized CMS system that is hosted on hundreds of sites they need to modify individual sites should the sites be in the main compository or within their own one,php

What compiler warning level do you recommend for different C C compilers gcc and g will let you get away with a lot on the default level I find the best warning level for me is Wall And I always try to remove fix the code for the warnings it generates Even the silly ones about using parenthesis for logical precedence rules or to say I really mean if x y What are your favorite levels for the different compilers such as Sun CC aCC HPUX Visual Studio intel Edit I just wanted to point out that I don t use Werror but I do understand it s utility on gcc g because I use warning this is a note to myself in a few places in my code Do all the compilers understand the warning macro,cpp

Let s say I have a class that implements the IDisposable interface Something like this MyClass uses some unmanaged resources hence the Dispose method from IDisposable releases those resources MyClass should be used like this using MyClass myClass new MyClass myClass DoSomething Now I want to implement a method that calls DoSomething asynchronously I add a new method to MyClass Now from the client side MyClass should be used like this using MyClass myClass new MyClass myClass AsyncDoSomething However if I don t do anything else this could fail as the object myClass might be disposed before DoSomething is called and throw an unexpected ObjectDisposedException So the call to the Dispose method either implicit or explicit should be delayed until the asynchronous call to DoSomething is done I think the code in the Dispose method should be executed in a asynchronous way and only once all asynchronous calls are resolved I d like to know which could be the best way to accomplish this Thanks NOTE For the sake of simplicity I haven t entered in the details of how Dispose method is implemented In real life I usually follow the Dispose pattern UPDATE Thank you so much for your responses I appreciate your effort As chakrit has commented I need that multiple calls to the async DoSomething can be made Ideally something like this should work fine using MyClass myClass new MyClass myClass AsyncDoSomething myClass AsyncDoSomething I ll study the counting semaphore it seems what I m looking for It could also be a design problem If I find it convenient I will share with you some bits of the real case and what MyClass really does,csharp

I ve always been one to err on the side of preventing exception conditions by never taking an action unless I am certain that there will be no errors I learned to program in C and this was the only way to really do things Working with C I frequently see more reactive programing try to do something and handle exceptions To me this seems like using exceptions as control statements The first few times I saw this I dismissed it as bad practice But over the past few months I ve seen it all over the place and just have to wonder is this accepted efficient or just an epidemic Update For a bit of clarification most of the exception handling I am seeing is things like try open file catch message box for file not found or even worse try open xml modify xml 100 lines of code catch message for unspecified error I understand there are times when exception handling is very good to use such as database connections but I m referring to the use of exceptions in place of more traditional control I asked this because I felt like this programming style was using exceptions as a crutch instead of as a recovery method and wanted to know if this was just something I d have to learn to expect in the C world,csharp

My webservice provider give me a large WSDL file but we are going to use only a few function inside I believe that the large WSDL have negative impact to the application performance We use the webservice in client appliction startup time and memory usage are issues Large WSDL means that jax ws will takes longer to do binding and will takes more memory for the stub class Is is possible that we trim WSDL file to a lightweight version Are there any tool for this purpose I do not think my webservice provider will generate another WSDL for us We may have to do it auto in the build script,java
I m using an iframe to display content that has links When the user clicks around in the iFrame and hits back it goes back in the iFrame This behavior is OK However once they re back to the first page of the iFrame and they hit back again the entire window is taken back to the previous page This is unwanted To prevent this behavior I ve put a fake back button within the iFrame In most cases this is bad UI in this case it works well I d like this fake back button to only go back if the previous page is the iFrame s page not the entire page When they hit the fake back button in the iFrame it should only move that iFrame back nothing else Is there a way to do this Does an iFrame get its own history object Something that might be of benefit the domain of the iFrame and the main window can be assumed to be distinct So if it s possible to read the global history object I can check to see if the previous page was mine by checking to see if the domain is mine If the domain is not mine the fake back button will be hidden or not do anything Help greatly appreciated and happy holidays,javascript

I m working in a project where we develop php on Zend using a mySQL database and the project is about to get to a point where it will be necessary to use version control not only for the actual code but also for the database Also we are getting a good production server and the actual production server will be a test server So i was wondering if you guys think its a good idea to standardize the IDE the programmers use and make them have a apache php mySQL installed in their boxes to test the code thus having a developers environment in each computer a test server and a production server If so what set up would you recommend to each part of this process especially mysql version control I ve never done that and how to make the deployment I know its a very big question and most have been answered in different questions but I would like a global answer about how is the faster better harder and stronger set up for this and how much time would we have to stop programming to actually have all this working and yes hiring an expert in the subject is pretty much a no no Thanks,php

I have a custom site I m building with automatic url rewriting using a custom engine The rewriting works fine as long as the page url doesn t end in somehting like htm or html For these pages it goes directly to the iis 404 page instead of hitting my rewriting engine first I have the wildcard handler in the Home Directory section of the IIS6 configuration of that website but these urls seem to be ignored by it altho things like css jpg js etc to get sent to the url handler in my web project How do i set up IIS6 to force these urls to get sent to the handler while still serving the page if it exists normally The handler basically does this if File Exists Request Path doMyRewriting I have to assume that using a block like this just and example the real one does some other stuff to format the Request Path to be proper with everything should run the doMyRewriting if the requested file does not exist otherwise it will serve the page normally Am I mistaken If I tell IIS specifically to send htm and html pages thru to the NET handler the rewriting works but if the page is actually there it will not serve it Any help would be greatly appreciated Thanks in advance,csharp

I use the following code to create countdowns in Javascript n is the number of times to repeat freq is the number of milliseconds to wait before executing funN is a function to call on each iteration typically a function that updates part of the DOM and funDone is the function to call when the countdown is complete function timer n freq funN funDone if n 0 funDone else setTimeout function funN n 1 timer n 1 freq funN funDone freq It can be called like so timer 10 1000 1 second function n console log A Counting n function console log A Done timer 10 500 function n console log B Counting n function console log B Done The advantage of this is that I can call timer as many times as I want without worrying about global variables etc Is there a better way to do this Is there a clean way to make setInterval stop after a certain number of calls without using global variables This code also creates a new lambda function with each call to setTimeout which seems like it could be problematic for large countdowns I m not sure how javascript s garbage collector handles this Is there a better way to do this Thanks,javascript

I need to do some processing on fairly large XML files large here being potentially upwards of a gigabyte in C including performing some complex xpath queries The problem I have is that the standard way I would normally do this through the System XML libraries likes to load the whole file into memory before it does anything with it which can cause memory problems with files of this size I don t need to be updating the files at all just reading them and querying the data contained in them Some of the XPath queries are quite involved and go across several levels of parent child type relationship I m not sure whether this will affect the ability to use a stream reader rather than loading the data into memory as a block One way I can see of making it work is to perform the simple analysis using a stream based approach and perhaps wrapping the XPath statements into XSLT transformations that I could run across the files afterward although it seems a little convoluted Alternately I know that there are some elements that the XPath queries will not run across so I guess I could break the document up into a series of smaller fragments based on it s original tree structure which could perhaps be small enough to process in memory without causing too much havoc I ve tried to explain my objective here so if I m barking up totally the wrong tree in terms of general approach I m sure you folks can set me right,csharp
I recently participated a project that replaced a mainframe system with a web asp net 2 0 VS2005 system The 3270 terminals are still much used and I respect the IMS CICS Cobol application designers for their work Users like the web application but one thing they keep ask for is Functionkeys and shortcuts that navigates directly to different web forms Do you know a way to implement function key shortcuts in asp net that will be like 3270 function key actions We are using asp menu as a content in master page but asp item does not support the accesskey attribute lt asp SiteMapDataSource ID _siteMapDataSource runat server ShowStartingNode False gt lt asp Menu ID Menu1 runat server DataSourceID _siteMapDataSource Orientation Horizontal gt lt asp Menu gt Update 24 jan 09 I liked John Sheehan answer Will implement it with the jQuery support in ASP Net 3 5 SP1,csharp
I understand that the goal of moving towards lt div gt tags from lt table gt makes sense since it is more semantic However I don t understand the benefit gained if you still need a clearing block to make column based layouts work For example lt Note location info amp personal info both float left gt lt div class contact gt lt div class personal info gt lt p gt Shawn etc etc lt p gt lt div gt lt div class location info gt lt p gt lt address gt etc lt address gt lt p gt lt div gt lt br style clear both gt lt clearing block gt lt div gt The extraneous lt br gt tag is used strictly to describe style and is required to make the layout work Doesn t this ruin all benefits gained from removing tables,html
I have a PHP application that makes extensive use of Javascript on the client side I have a simple system on the PHP side for providing translators an easy way to provide new languages But there are cases where javascript needs to display language elements to the user maybe an OK or cancel button or loading or something With PHP I just have a text file that is cached on the server side which contains phrase codes on one side and their translation on the other A translator just needs to replace the english with their own language and send me the translated version which I integrate into the application I want something similar on the client side It occurred to me to have a javascript include that is just a set of translated constants but then every page load is downloading a potentially large file most of which is unnecessary Has anyone had to deal with this If so what was your solution EDIT To be clear I m not referring to on the fly translations here The translations have already been prepared and are ready to go I just need them to be made available to the client in an efficient way,javascript

I m trying to create a set of custom performance counters to be used by my ASP NET application I use the following code to increment the counters internal static void Increment String instanceName DistributedCacheCounterInstanceType counterInstanceType var permission new PerformanceCounterPermission PerformanceCounterPermissionAccess Write Environment MachineName CounterName permission Assert var counter new PerformanceCounter CategoryName CounterName instanceName false counter RawValue Use RawValue instead of Increment to avoid locking counter Close This works perfectly in unit tests and also in Cassini on my dev box Vista Business x64 and I can watch the counters working in Performance Monitor However the counters don t seem to register any incrementation in my production environment Win Server 2003 x64 The counter instances themselves are available but they all just show for the last average minimum maximum display Any ideas as to what I could be doing wrong EDIT Here s a perhaps somewhat outdated MSDN article that I used for reference EDIT 2 I m using VS 2008 NET Framework v3 5 SP1 if that makes any difference EDIT 3 Just found this article about 32 bit 64 bit app and monitor mismatching but I m not sure how it applies to my situation if at all Cassini is indeed a 32 bit app but I had no problem viewing the values on my 64 bit system On my production server both the app and the system are 64 bit but I can t see the values EDIT 4 The values are showing up when I run the 32 bit perfmon on the production server So I suppose now the question is why can t I read the values in the 64 bit perfmon EDIT 5 It actually does appear to be working it was just that I had to restart my instance of perfmon because it was open before the counters were created,csharp
Years ago I learned the hard way about precision problems with floats so I quit using them However I still run into code using floats and it make me cringe because I know some of the calculations will be inaccurate So when is it appropriate to use a float EDIT As info I don t think that I ve come across a program where the accuracy of a number isn t important But I would be interested in hearing examples,csharp
I d like to implement database caching functionality in PHP based on reference counts For example code to access the record in table foo with an ID of 1 might look like fooRecord fooTable gt getRecord 1 The first time this is called fooTable fetches the appropriate record from the database stores it in an internal cache and returns it Any subsequent calls to getRecord 1 will return another reference to the same object in memory fooRecord signals fooTable when it destructs and if there are no remaining references it stores any changes back to the database and removes it from the cache The problem is that PHP s memory management abstracts away the details about reference counts I ve searched PECL and Google for an extension to do so but found no results So question 1 is does such an extension exist In an alternative approach fooTable returns a super sneaky fake object It pretends to be the record by forwarding __call __set and __get and its constructor and destructor provide the appropriate hooks for reference counting purposes Tests works great except that it breaks type hinting All my methods that were expecting a FooRecord object now get a Sneaky object or maybe a FooSneaky if I feel like creating an empty subclass of Sneaky for every one of my tables which I do not Also I m afraid it will confuse maintenance programmers such as myself Question 2 Is there another approach I ve missed,php
I have to verify the signature on a file that may be as large as 2Gb and I want to do so in a way that is as memory efficient as possible For various reasons the file will already be loaded completely into memory and is accessed using an InputStream by the application I would like to verify the signature using the stream interface but the JCA Signature class update method only accepts byte and related classes How can I do this efficiently I don t want to load the beast into a second byte array otherwise we ll be seeing some seriously high memory use but the interface doesn t seem to support it otherwise Update If it matters the signing algorithm is SHA 1,java

I ve recently bumped into something called IOCP on the windows platform to be more precise Input Output Control Ports This seems to be the most efficient way to code your server software when it needs to hold thousands of users concurrently Correct me if I m wrong but thread per socket polling and asynchronous callbacks thread on every callback are not efficient enough I am wondering if there are any 3rd party libraries available that implement this concept I know the win32 api supplies us with CreateIoCompletionPort FreeBSD has kqueue and linux in general can use dev epoll that works somewhat similarly But isn t there a crossplatform library such as boost thread that handles this stuff for me,cpp
I sometimes define Business Logic classes to help my ASPX code behind classes It makes the most sense to me to include them both in the code behind file since they work together However I d occasionally like to access the Business Logic classes from higher level classes defined in App_Code but they aren t automatically accessible outside of the file Thus the question it is easy to access classes defined in App_Code but how do I access classes defined elsewhere UPDATE One other thing the ASPX page class and the App_Code class are in the same namespace that isn t the issue NOTE I have taken the advice of those who have responded thanks guys and am refactoring to make class access easier However I don t think the question is actually answered yet in the case of an ASP NET Website project I don t need the answer any more but if someone could clarify what makes classes visible when they are outside of App_Code it may well help someone else or even me down the road,csharp

I came across a site that demonstrated a Javascript library and it asked that you please not link to the Javascript file directly from your site That s a reasonable request In fact it wouldn t have occurred to me to do that instead of hosting it myself but I guess will try and save on bandwidth any way they can This got me thinking does Apache in a shared hosting environment come with any simple means of either preventing this or at least making it a little more difficult by looking at the HTTP_REFERRER or the likes Or perhaps even just ensuring you have a PHP session,php

Is there a good way in a javascript onfocus handler to trampoline the focus to the next item in the tab order without having to manually enter the ID of the item that should be next I built an HTML date picker in Django jQuery It s a line edit followed by a calendar icon that pops up a calendar I want to be able to tab from the line edit to the next input skipping the link for the calendar icon I mean for it to be a generalized widget so I can t hardcode the id of whatever is next and call focus I know I could set tabindex attributes on everything but that s more manual than I d like Also iirc that wouldn t prevent it from taking the focus it would just put it at the end of the tab order,javascript
I m working on a new project and I m using the repository pattern I have my repository that pulls the data from the database and a service class which uses the repository and does all the business logic something similar to the following public class UserRepository IUserRepository public IQueryable lt User gt GetUsers do stuff public class UserService public IList lt User gt GetUserById var rep new UserRepository var users rep GetUsers do business logic return users ToList Would you test both the UserService and the UserRepository or do you think testing just the Service would suffice I figure since the service is using the repository it should be fun but it does kill code coverage,csharp

We are looking to implement Optimistic locking in our WCF WPF application So far the best way I ve come up with doing this is to implement a generic Optimistic which will store a copy of the original and any changes so it will store two copies the original and modified of any value object that can be modified Is this the best way of doing it For example a UserVO will be wrapped by the generic as a Optimistic When a change is made to the Optimistic the change will be made to the modified copy stored in the Optimistic while the original also stored in the Optimistic will remain intact The main issue seems to be that it will use up twice the space and hence bandwidth Thanks EDIT The solution needs to be database independent and it would be useful to be able to specify an conflict resolution policy per value object eg A user object might try and merge if the updated rows weren t changed but a transaction object would always require user intervention,csharp

So I m refactoring a legacy codebase I ve inherited and in the process I found a static class that encapsulates the logic for launching 3rd party applications It essentially looks like this shortened for brevity to only show one application using System IO using System Configuration public static class ExternalApplications public string App1Path get if null thisApp1Path thisApp1Path Configuration AppSettings Get App1Path return thisApp1Path private string thisApp1Path null public bool App1Exists if string IsNullOrEmpty App1Path throw new ConfigurationException App1Path not specified return File Exists App1Path public void ExecuteApp1 string args Code to launch the application It s a nice attempt to separate the external applications from the rest of the code but it occurs to me that this could have been refactored further What I have in mind is something like this using System IO public abstract class ExternalApplicationBase protected ExternalApplicationBase InitializeFromConfiguration public string Path get protected set public bool Exists if string IsNullOrEmpty this Path throw new ConfigurationException Path not specified return File Exists this Path public virtual void Execute string args Implementation to launch the application protected abstract InitializeFromConfiguration public class App1 ExternalApplicationBase protected virtual void InitializeFromConfiguration Implementation to initialize this application from the application s configuration file public class App2 ExternalApplicationBase protected virtual void InitializeFromConfiguration Implementation to initialize this application from the application s configuration file My concerns are as follows A class interface or other construct may already exist that does this and I just haven t stumbled across it It may be overkill for what I want to do Note however that the application uses at least three separate 3rd party applications that I have identified so far and more are almost certain to pop up I m not entirely comfortable with the name of the base class It seems fuzzy and not very informative but I couldn t think of much better given that Application is already well defined reserved by the Framework and would create a gross level of confusion were I to use it The idea is that I want to be able to keep the application configuration data it s path and executable name in the App Config file and check for its existence when my application starts up when my software needs to launch the software I want to do it through a single method call and not have the code building command lines and trying to launch the software manually as it currently does So I m sending out a request for help guidance and suggestions Anything you can profer is greatly appreciated P S I m asking this here because I work as I frequently do as a sole developer at my firm I don t have anyone else to bounce these ideas off of You guys have tons of experience with this stuff and it would be foolish of me not to ask for your advice so I hope you ll all bear with me Thanks in advance,csharp

I m developing an Windows Forms application that requires me to call a separate program to perform a task The program is a console application and I need to redirect standard output from the console to a TextBox in my program I have no problem executing the program from my application but I don t know how to redirect the output to my application I need to capture output while the program is running using events The console program isn t meant to stop running until my application stops and the text changes constantly at random intervals What I m attempting to do is simply hook output from the console to trigger an event handler which can then be used to update the TextBox I am using C to code the program and using the NET framework for development The original application is not a NET program EDIT Here s example code of what I m trying to do In my final app I ll replace Console WriteLine with code to update the TextBox I tried to set a breakpoint in my event handler and it isn t even reached void Method var p new Process var path C ConsoleApp exe p StartInfo FileName path p StartInfo UseShellExecute false p OutputDataReceived p_OutputDataReceived p Start static void p_OutputDataReceived object sender DataReceivedEventArgs e Console WriteLine gt gt gt 0 e Data,csharp
I d like to have the nightly build check for how many NotImplementedExeptions there are in my NET code so hopefully we can remove them all before releasing My first thought is that FxCop might be a good tool to do this Does anyone have a custom FxCop rule for this How would I go about creating one myself,csharp
We re currently developing a new piece of hand held software I cant discuss the nature of the application so I ll use an example instead We re designing hand held software for managing a school We want to modularise each aspect of the system so that different schools can use different features Our system will start with a main menu and a login screen I d like this to be the base of the system and be where the modules will be added to I e I ll have a project called SchoolPda I then want to have different modules I e I want a registration module that will handle student registrations I want a classroom module for managing classroom cleanliness etc The way I d possibly see this working is including not including different dlls and having the base system s main menu expose buttons to access those modules if the dlls exist That s just the kind of thing we re after Does anyone have any experience doing something like this What would be the best way of doing it We don t need to worry about the database as the database will always be the full database but aspects wont get populated if the associated modules do not exist,csharp
Google is failing me on this one Let s say I have some ECMA script that I ve compiled to an ABC bytecode file using the compiler in the Open Source Flex SDK Is it within the terms of use That I can t seem to find for me to use the AVM2 specification from adobe to create a new interpreter for this file The best I can manage is a sentence in wikipedia that says that the flash specification is available without restriction I m not making a flash player though and AFAIK the AVM2 spec is separate from the SWF spec Does anyone know off hand if my intentions are legal,javascript
I m writing a semi generic form plugin using jQuery in order to speed up the development of the project I m working on The plan is that a jTemplates template contains the fields my plugin looks through the template to find any required multi lingual resources requests them from the server and then packages everything up into a JavaScript object that is then passed to a custom function on submit Everything is working nicely except the standard when enter is pressed submit the form code that you need to do when you re faking a form opts coreElement find input type text keypress function evt if evt keyCode evt which 13 opts coreElement find saveButton click The issue is that in Firefox at least I haven t checked other browsers yet if you ve entered information in a similarly named textbox before you get your form history If you then select one of those suggested values by hitting enter it submits the form Not great if you re on the first input on the page Really rather annoying actually The obvious solution seems to be to insert a form element around the fields and stopping any possible submission of this dummy form via jQuery Fortunately I have the luxury of doing this as I m in ASP NET MVC but what if I wasn t What if my plugin didn t know whether it was already inside a form and so had to keep itself to itself What if I was in standard WebForms ASP NET and I had to manually target each input s return key to the correct submit button Is there a way perhaps through the event object itself to detect the context of the keypress so I can filter out the selection of form history items,javascript
I wanted to run something by you guys I am starting a new project which is roughly the following Important information I am using PHP and MySQL Every minute I get a list of to do transactions from an API from different users Example user1 send 1 to user2 userx send 2 to usera userw send 0 50 to user2 etc Lets say user1 wants to send 1 to user2 There are two posibilities it s succesful or it s unsuccessful because there are insufficient funds or the user spelled the username wrong If it s unsuccesfull I send out a message to the user I am now facing several options please bare with me through my thought process Option 1 Create a database table with transactions that need to be processed and use a cronjob that processes them every minute The risk here is that the script could run against an error or a timeout and the other transactions would still show In Progress in the database table So I would need a second script to check that against a timestamp Option 2 Create an API or Function which gets called for each transaction after I receive them and brings me a response From which then I can call another API or Function to deal with that response or move on to the next transaction However I would still have to put them in a database table since I can t risk losing them if the script stops executing So it would work as follow put all transactions in database table start transaction when finished transaction delete from table start transaction 2 Both options are flawed because you don t know how long the list of transactions will be If it s long PHP is definitely not optimal to run for a long time using set timeout to zero is risky I am looking to create a solution that will scale with PHP So I was thinking about an Option 3 Option 3 Optimal solution Use an API to return 10 transactions In database set a flag to say they are sent to a script and timestamp to say when they were sent PHP script retreives 10 transactions from API handles 10 transactions Once transaction completed delete it from this table and copy it to completed transaction table Have a cronjob script check every 3 minutes if timesent is greater then X minutes based on an upper bound of the execution time of 10 transactions If it is greater set them to not sent so they can be sent out again As you can see I wrote down my whole thought process on this and am looking for input There s bound to be stuff that I missed Also please realize that these are not real financial transactions it s just the best metafore I could use to make it clear Thank you very much Ice,php
I have six string variables say str11 str12 str13 str21 str21 and str23 I need to compare combination of these variables The combinations I have to check is str11 str12 str13 as one group and str21 str22 str23 as other group I have to compare these two groups Now I m in confusion which method should I use for comparison Can I append strings of same group and compare which is only one comparison say str11 append str12 append str13 eqauls str21 append str22 append str23 Or Should I go for individual 3 comparisons if str11 equals str21 if str12 equals str22 if str13 equals str23 What is performance factor which costs me because of string length when I do string comparison Lets us assume all strings are of same approx length,java
Is there a way in Java to have a map where the type parameter of a value is tied to the type parameter of a key What I want to write is something like the following public class Foo This declaration won t compile what should it be private static Map lt Class lt T gt T gt defaultValues These two methods are just fine public static lt T gt void setDefaultValue Class lt T gt clazz T value defaultValues put clazz value public static lt T gt T getDefaultValue Class lt T gt clazz return defaultValues get clazz That is I can store any default value against a Class object provided the value s type matches that of the Class object I don t see why this shouldn t be allowed since I can ensure when setting getting values that the types are correct EDIT Thanks to cletus for his answer I don t actually need the type parameters on the map itself since I can ensure consistency in the methods which get set values even if it means using some slightly ugly casts,java

I m currently working on a hobby project written in Java containing about two different JFrames with about 3 4 JPanels each The problem I m facing is that I m not so sure how to handle the interaction with my controller and different view classes For instance I ve an article by Sun on Java App design with MVC where they list the option to let all the communications between model and view go through the controller as the most modern one a tactic I ve been taught as well and should do just fine However it doesn t quite go as deep as to explain how to handle all the ActionListeners involved for all the elements and different panels The way to go I ve been taught so far is to either use one controller and set the ActionListener to the various objects through getters and keep track of the active panel The alternative my awesome Java book gives is to just stick to inner classes for each view class Either method seems to result in pretty nasty code while I d prefer one or several controllers with as little bloat as possible My question of course is how would you assign the ActionListeners as neatly and efficiently as possible while keeping the controller s usable,java
Does the Hibernate API support object result sets in the form of a collection other than a List For example I have process that runs hundreds of thousands of iterations in order to create some data for a client This process uses records from a Value table for example in order to create this output for each iteration With a List I would have to iterate through the entire list in order to find a certain value which is expensive I d like to be able to return a TreeMap and specify a key programmatically so I can search the collection for the specific value I need Can Hibernate do this for me,java

I am trying to write a JTextPane which supports some sort of coloring as the user is typing the text I am running some code that colors the text according to a certain algorithm This works well The problem is that the coloring operations is registered with the undo manager a DefaultDocumentEvent with EventType CHANGE So when the user clicks undo the coloring disappears Only at the second undo request the text itself is rolled back Note that the coloring algorithm is somewhat slow so I cannot color the text as it is being inserted If I try to prevent the CHANGE events from reaching the undo manager I get an exception after several undo requests this is because the document contents are not conforming to what the undoable edit object expects Any ideas,java

I have class B which inherits from class A The superclass A is abstract containing one abstract method I don t want to implement the abstract method in class B therefore I need to declare class B as abstract as well Declaring class B abstract two things are working for me the programs compile and run correctly 1 I don t declare any abstract methods in class B even thought the class is abstract This works I assume because the class inherits the abstract method of class A and this is enough for the class to be declared as abstract we don t need any other abstract methods directly declared in the class 2 I do declare the same abstract method in class B as it is declared in class A This is some kind of overriding not in the same sense as overriding in java using the same header but providing different implementation here I just use again the same header of the method Both things are working and I am not sure whether they are both Ok and whether some of them is preferred more correct that the other Are the two ways the same do they mean the same to Java Here I give some example classes so that what I mean is more clear for you Case 1 public abstract class A public abstract String giveSum public abstract class B extends A Case 2 public abstract class A public abstract String giveSum public abstract class B extends A public abstract String giveSum Regards,java

I guess this could also be asked as to how long the created type name is attached to an anonymous type Here s the issue A blog had something like this var anonymousMagic new test UserName lblShowText Text lblShowText Text Format UserName test As sort of a wish list and a couple ways to go at it Being bored and adventurous I took to creating an string extension method that could handle this var anonymousMagic new test UserName test UserID lblShowText Text UserName is user number UserID FormatAdvanced anonymousMagic With the idea that I would get the property info from the anonymous type and match that to the bracketted strings Now with property info comes reflection so I would want to save the property info the first time the type came through so that I wouldn t have to get it again So I did something like this public static String FormatAdvanced this String stringToFormat Object source Dictionary lt String PropertyInfo gt info Type test String typeName currentType source GetType typeName currentType Name info list is a static list for the class holding this method if infoList null infoList new Dictionary lt String Dictionary lt String PropertyInfo gt gt if infoList ContainsKey typeName info infoList typeName else info test GetProperties ToDictionary item gt item Name infoList Add typeName info foreach var propertyInfoPair in info String currentKey String replacement replacement propertyInfoPair Value GetValue source null ToString currentKey propertyInfoPair Key if stringToFormat Contains currentKey stringToFormat stringToFormat Replace currentKey replacement return stringToFormat Now in testing it seems to keep the name it created for the anonymous type so that the second time through it doesn t get the property info off the type but off the dictionary If multiple people are hitting this method at the same time is it pretty much going to work in a Session like fassion IE the names of the types will be specific to each instance of the program Or would it be even worse than that At what point does that name get chucked and overwritten,csharp

I m writing a Java client application to receive live M JPEG video from an IP camera The video is sent by the camera as an endless multipart HTTP message where each part is a single JPEG frame I need to process each of these frames as they arrive so I m hoping there s a way to make an HTTP request that asynchronously triggers an event as each message part video frame is received Is anyone aware of any libraries that can do this All the examples I can find on Google won t work because they use blocking calls that only parse the response and break it up into parts after the entire response has finished being received which obviously won t work for an endless response I realise I could manually break up the data into parts as it arrives by searching for the message boundary but it just feels like I would be reinventing the wheel,java

I have a relatively simple application up and working with some basic functionality which i have built as a bit of a project I would like to now build on that and add some more complex features including login The code has got quite complex and it s written in plain php so all the presentation code is mixed in with the logic I have decided that before I go any further I d like to re factor it to separate this out so it s easier to maintain and add to I ve been researching MVC and think that s the way i should be going I had decided to give the zend framework a go and have spent a while trying to get to grips with it however I have found the learning curve extremely steep as I have no object oriented experience Is there another framework or option that anyone could recommend I am considering having a look at cake based on reading other posts in this forum but I d accept any guidance my requirments are easiest to learn for non OO experience includes some login authentication features handles database interaction with mysql easily All suggestions appreciated,php
Is there a canonical or recommended pattern for implementing arithmetic operator overloading in C number like classes From the C FAQ we have an exception safe assignment operator that avoids most problems class NumberImpl class Number NumberImpl Impl Number amp Number operator const Number amp rhs NumberImpl tmp new NumberImpl rhs Impl delete Impl Impl tmp return this But for other operators etc very little advice is given other than to make them behave like the operators on built in types Is there a standard way of defining these This is what I ve come up with are there pitfalls I m not seeing Member operator Number amp Number operator const Number amp rhs Impl gt Value rhs Impl gt Value Obviously this is more complicated return this Non member non friend addition operator Number operator Number lhs const Number amp rhs return lhs rhs,cpp
If I have a class as follows class Example_Class private int x int y public Example_Class x 8 y 9 Example_Class And a struct as follows struct int x int y example_struct Is the structure in memory of the example_struct simmilar to that in Example_Class for example if I do the following struct example_struct foo_struct Example_Class foo_class Example_Class memcpy amp foo_struct amp foo_class sizeof foo_struct will foo_struct x 8 and foo_struct y 9 ie the same values as the x y values in the foo_class The reason I ask is I have a C library don t want to change it that is sharing an object with C code and I want to use a struct to represent the object coming from the C library I m only interested in the attributes of the object I know the ideal situation would be to have Example_class wrap arround a common structure between the C and C code but it is not going to be easy to change the C library in use,cpp

Is there a pattern where in WPF I can build a simple UI form from an XML like definition file pulled from a database It would allow the user to enter data into this form and submit it back The data would be sent back in an XML structure that would closely exactly mimic the UI definition The definition should include the data type and if it was a required value or not I would then like to map these data types and required values to Data Validation Rules so the form could not be submitted unless it passes the check It should also handle the ability to have lists of repeating data I am in the planning stages of this project and have fairly good flexibility in the design at this point though I am pretty sure I need to stick to the desktop not web since I may be doing some Office Inter op stuff as well What technology stack would you recommend I think XMAL and WPF may be close to the answer I have also looked at XUL but it doesn t seem ready or useful for C Found this article from MSDN in 2002 Thank you Keith,csharp
I m trying to call a stored procedure on a SQL 2005 server from C NET 2 0 using DateTime as a value to a SqlParameter The SQL type in the stored procedure is datetime Executing the sproc from SQL Management Studio works fine But everytime I call it from C I get an error about the date format When I run SQL Profiler to watch the calls I then copy paste the exec call to see what s going on These are my observations and notes about what I ve attempted 1 If I pass the DateTime in directly as a DateTime or converted to SqlDateTime the field is surrounding by a PAIR of single quotes such as Date_Of_Birth N 1 8 2009 8 06 17 PM 2 If I pass the DateTime in as a string I only get the single quotes 3 Using SqlDateTime ToSqlString does not result in a UTC formatted datetime string even after converting to universal time 4 Using DateTime ToString does not result in a UTC formatted datetime string 5 Manually setting the DbType for the SqlParameter to DateTime does not change the above observations So my questions then is how on earth do I get C to pass the properly formatted time in the SqlParameter Surely this is a common use case why is it so difficult to get working I can t seem to convert DateTime to a string that is SQL compatable e g 2009 01 08T08 22 45 EDIT RE BFree the code to actually execute the sproc is as follows using SqlCommand sprocCommand new SqlCommand sprocName sprocCommand Connection transaction Connection sprocCommand Transaction transaction sprocCommand CommandType System Data CommandType StoredProcedure sprocCommand Parameters AddRange parameters ToArray sprocCommand ExecuteNonQuery To go into more detail about what I have tried parameters Add new SqlParameter Date_Of_Birth DOB parameters Add new SqlParameter Date_Of_Birth DOB ToUniversalTime parameters Add new SqlParameter Date_Of_Birth DOB ToUniversalTime ToString SqlParameter param new SqlParameter Date_Of_Birth System Data SqlDbType DateTime param Value DOB ToUniversalTime parameters Add param SqlParameter param new SqlParameter Date_Of_Birth SqlDbType DateTime param Value new SqlDateTime DOB ToUniversalTime parameters Add param parameters Add new SqlParameter Date_Of_Birth new SqlDateTime DOB ToUniversalTime ToSqlString Additional EDIT The one I thought most likely to work SqlParameter param new SqlParameter Date_Of_Birth System Data SqlDbType DateTime param Value DOB Results in this value in the exec call as seen in the SQL Profiler Date_Of_Birth 2009 01 08 15 08 21 813 If I modify this to be Date_Of_Birth 2009 01 08T15 08 21 It works but it won t parse with pair of single quotes and it wont convert to a DateTime correctly with the space between the date and time and with the milliseconds on the end Update and Success I had copy pasted the code above after the request from below I trimmed things here and there to be concise Turns out my problem was in the code I left out which I m sure any one of you would have spotted in an instant I had wrapped my sproc calls inside a transaction Turns out that I was simply not doing transaction Commit I m ashamed to say it but there you have it I still don t know what s going on with the syntax I get back from the profiler A coworker watched with his own instance of the profiler from his computer and it returned proper syntax Watching the very SAME executions from my profiler showed the incorrect syntax It acted as a red herring making me believe there was a query syntax problem instead of the much more simple and true answer which was that I need to commit the transaction I marked an answer below as correct and threw in some up votes on others because they did after all answer the question even if they didn t fix my specific brain lapse issue,csharp

I ve simplified a bug I m experiencing down to the following lines of code int vals new int 8 for int i 0 i lt 1500 i vals new Random i nextInt 8 System out println Arrays toString vals The output is 0 0 0 0 0 1310 190 0 Is this just an artifact of choosing consecutive numbers to seed Random and then using nextInt with a power of 2 If so are there other pitfalls like this I should be aware of and if not what am I doing wrong I m not looking for a solution to the above problem just some understanding about what else could go wrong Dan well written analysis As the javadoc is pretty explicit about how numbers are calculated it s not a mystery as to why this happened as much as if there are other anomalies like this to watch out for I didn t see any documentation about consecutive seeds and I m hoping someone with some experience with java util Random can point out other common pitfalls As for the code the need is for several parallel agents to have repeatably random behavior who happen to choose from an enum 8 elements long as their first step Once I discovered this behavior the seeds all come from a master Random object created from a known seed In the former sequentially seeded version of the program all behavior quickly diverged after that first call to nextInt so it took quite a while for me to narrow the program s behavior down to the RNG library and I d like to avoid that situation in the future,java

Ever stumbled on a tutorial that you feel is of great value but not quite explained properly That s my dilemma I know THIS TUTORIAL has some value but I just can t get it Where do you call each function Which function should be called first and which next and which third Will all functions be called in all files in an application Does anyone know of a better way cure the Back Button Blues I m wondering if this will stir some good conversation that includes the author of the article The part I m particularly interested in is controlling the back button in order to prevent form duplicate entries into a database when the back button is pressed Basically you want to control the back button by calling the following three functions during the execution of the scripts in your application In what order exactly to call the functions see questions above is not clear from the tutorial All forwards movement is performed by using my scriptNext function This is called within the current script in order to activate the new script function scriptNext script_id proceed forwards to a new script if empty script_id trigger_error script id is not defined E_USER_ERROR if get list of screens used in this session page_stack _SESSION page_stack if in_array script_id page_stack remove this item and any following items from the stack array do last array_pop page_stack while last script_id if add next script to end of array and update session data page_stack script_id _SESSION page_stack page_stack now pass control to the designated script location http _SERVER HTTP_HOST script_id header Location location exit scriptNext When any script has finished its processing it terminates by calling my scriptPrevious function This will drop the current script from the end of the stack array and reactivate the previous script in the array function scriptPrevious go back to the previous script as defined in PAGE_STACK get id of current script script_id _SERVER PHP_SELF get list of screens used in this session page_stack _SESSION page_stack if in_array script_id page_stack remove this item and any following items from the stack array do last array_pop page_stack while last script_id update session data _SESSION page_stack page_stack if if count page_stack gt 0 previous array_pop page_stack reactivate previous script location http _SERVER HTTP_HOST previous else no previous scripts so terminate session session_unset session_destroy revert to default start page location http _SERVER HTTP_HOST index php if header Location location exit scriptPrevious Whenever a script is activated which can be either through the scriptNext or scriptPrevious functions or because of the BACK button in the browser it will call the following function to verify that it is the current script according to the contents of the program stack and take appropriate action if it is not function initSession initialise session data get program stack if isset _SESSION page_stack use existing stack page_stack _SESSION page_stack else create new stack which starts with current script page_stack _SERVER PHP_SELF _SESSION page_stack page_stack if check that this script is at the end of the current stack actual _SERVER PHP_SELF expected page_stack count page_stack 1 if expected actual if in_array actual page_stack script is within current stack so remove anything which follows while page_stack count page_stack 1 actual null array_pop page_stack while _SESSION page_stack page_stack if set script id to last entry in program stack actual page_stack count page_stack 1 location http _SERVER HTTP_HOST actual header Location location exit if continue processing initSession The action taken depends on whether the current script exists within the program stack or not There are three possibilities The current script is not in the page_stack array in which case it is not allowed to continue Instead it is replaced by the script which is at the end of the array The current script is in the page_stack array but it is not the last entry In this case all following entries in the array are removed The current script is the last entry in the page_stack array This is the expected situation Drinks all round,php

I ve been a fan of EasyMock for many years now and thanks to SO I came across references to PowerMock and it s ability to mock Constructors and static methods both of which cause problems when retrofitting tests to a legacy codebase Obviously one of the huge benefits of unit testing and TDD is the way it leads to forces a much cleaner design and it seems to me that the introduction of PowerMock may detract from that I would see this mostly manifesting itself as Going back to initialising collaborators rather than injecting them Using statics rather than making the method be owned by a collaborator In addition to this something doesn t quite sit right with me about my code being bytecode manipulated for the test I can t really give a concrete reason for this just that it makes me feel a little uneasy as it s just for the test and not for production At my current gig we re really pushing for the unit tests as a way for people to improve their coding practices and it feels like introducing PowerMock into the equation may let people skip that step somewhat and so I m loathe to start using it Having said that I can really see where making use of it can cut down on the amount of refactoring that needs to be done to start testing a class I guess my question is what are peoples experiences of using PowerMock or any other similar library for these features would you make use of them and how much overall do you want your tests influencing your design,java
I m developing an user control that I need for a project the control have around 13 rows 7 columns of textboxes comboboxes everything on a form autoscrollable The problem is that in execution time when scrolling the content refreshing is very very slow Some idea Using a datagridview is not an option Edit I should be more specific the 13 row controls are in the usercontrol I have changed the uc s doublebuferred property to true I can t change the child controls because all them are standard text and comboboxes so there isn t such property In the main form I m creating around 7 of this usercontrols dynamically inside of an autoscrollable panel the problem comes scrolling the panel the refresh is extremely slow And yes I neither can believe that the winforms could be so bad Regards,csharp
Is there an easy way to select either a file OR a folder from the same dialog In many apps I create I allow for both files or folders as input Until now i always end up creating a switch to toggle between file or folder selection dialogs or stick with drag and drop functionality only Since this seems such a basic thing i would imagine this has been created before but googling does not result in much information So it looks like i would need to start from scratch and create a custom selection Dialog but I rather not introduce any problems by reinventing the wheel for such a trivial task Anybody any tips or existing solutions To keep the UI consistent it would be nice if it is possible to extend the OpenFileDialog or the FolderBrowserDialog,csharp
I have created an intranet for our company using PHP The same menu appears on every page and includes links to sensitive pages and documents like Word files Currently only in office employees have access to the site but we d like to open it up to some out of office contractors The catch is that I d have to restrict access for certain content I know how to password protect site directories with Apache but I d rather hide the menu options themselves How would you approach this Clarification This is in an environment where everyone is logged in to our Windows network locally or via VPN but currently nobody has to log in to see my intranet site The ideal solution would not require them to do anything extra if that s possible,php

I am in a situation where I would like to accept a LOT of log events controlled by me notably the logging agent I am preparing for slf4j and then analyze them interactively I am not as such interested in a facility that presents formatted log files but one that can accept log events as objects and allow me to sort and display on e g threads and timelines etc Chainsaw could maybe be an option but is currently not compatible with logback which I use for technical reasons Is there any project with stand alone viewers or embedded in an IDE which would be suitable for this kind of log handling I am aware that I am approaching what might be suitable for a profiler so if there is a profiler projekt suitable for this kind of data acquisition and display where I can feed the event pipe I would like to hear about it Thanks for all feedback Update 2009 03 19 I have found that there is not a log viewer which allows me to see what I would like a visual display of events with coordinates determined by day and time etc so I have decided to create a very terse XML format derived from the log4j XMLLayout adapted to be as readable as possible while still being valid XML snippets and then use the Microsoft LogParser to extract the information I need for postprocessing in other tools,java

Are these two equivalent char aString This is a string char aString This is a string From my understanding C stores strings by their addresses so the pointer is getting a valid address I assume the strings are also stored as type char But how does it know how much memory to allocate for the string Normally char arrays need their array size preset I believe the type arrays are counted by the compiler before compilation Is this what happens for the string literal pointer as well On to my second question what is the difference between these two int someNumber int someNumber new int The second is supposed to be dynamic allocation If I understand the concept right it allocates the memory as soon as it reads the declaration But what happens in the standard declaration Basically I need to understand how dynamic allocation is advantageous over standard declarations,cpp

By default when Django runs against sqlite backend it creates a new in memory database for a test That means for every class that derives from unittest TestCase I get a new database Can this be changed so that it is cleared before every test method is run Example I am testing a manager class that provides additional abstraction on top of Django persistent objects The code looks more less like that class TestForManager unittest TestCase def testAddingBlah self manager Manager self assertEquals manager getBlahs 0 manager addBlah self assertEquals manager getBlahs 1 def testAddingBlahInDifferentWay self manager Manager self assertEquals manager getBlahs 0 manager addBlahInDifferentWay self assertEquals manager getBlahs 1 Now the first assertion of second test fails because the state of the database is preserved between test calls and there already is an instance of Blah in the database,python

String s in C are immutable and threadsafe But what when you have a public getter property Like this public String SampleProperty get private set If we have two threads and the first is calling get and the second is calling set at the same time what will happen IMHO the set must made a lock to be thread safe like this private string sampleField private object threadSafer new object public String SampleProperty get return this sampleField private set lock threadSafer sampleField value,csharp
Given an example of calling two web services methods from a session bean what if an exception is thrown between the calls to two methods In the case of not calling the web services the transaction will rollback and no harm done However the web service will not rollback Of course even with a single web service there is a problem While this is a generic question I am interested in solutions having to do with EJB session beans An easy and customized answer would be to add a special rollback method to the web service for each real functionality method What I am asking for is some standardized way to do so,java

First of all I have to admit that my programming skills are pretty limited and I took over a really small existing C OOP project where I try to push my own stuff in Unfortunately I m experiencing a problem which goes beyond my knowledge and I hope to find some help here I m working with a third party library which cannot be changed for grabbing images from a camera and will use some placeholder names here The third party library has a function ThirdPartyGrab to start a continuous live grab and takes a pointer to a function which will be called every time a new frame arrives So in a normal C application it goes like this ThirdPartyGrab HookFunction HookFunction needs to be declared as long _stdcall HookFunction long long void or BUF_HOOK_FUNCTION_PTR which is declared as typedef long _stdcall HOOK_FUNCTION_PTR long long void Now I have a C application and a class MyFrameGrabber which should encapsulate everything I do So I put in the hook function as a private member like this long _stdcall HookFunction long long void Also there is a public void function StartGrab in my class which should start the Grab Inside I try to call ThirdPartyGrab HookFunction which not surprisingly fails It says that the function call to MyFrameGrabber HookFunction misses the argument list and I should try to use amp MyFrameGrabber HookFunction to create a pointer instead However passing amp MyFrameGrabber HookFunction instead results in another error that this cannot be converted to BUF_HOOK_FUNCTION_PTR After reading through the C FAQ function pointers I think I understand the problem but can t make up a solution I tried to make the hook function static but this also results in a conversion error I also thought of putting the hook function outside of the class but I need to use class functions inside the hook function Is there another way or do I need to change my whole concept EDIT 14 01 08 I tested the singleton workaround since I cannot change the third party library and the void pointer is only for data that is used inside the hook function Unfortunately it didn t worked out of the box like I hoped I don t know if the static function needs to be in a separate class so I put it in my MyFrameGrabber class static MyFrameGrabber amp instance static MyFrameGrabber _instance return _instance long Hook long long void Implementation is in a separate cpp file In my cpp file I have the call_hook function long MFTYPE call_hook long x MIL_ID y void MPTYPE z return MyFrameGrabber instance Hook x y z void MyFrameGrabber grab ThirdPartyGrab call_hook But this gives me an error in static MatroxFrameGrabber _instance that no matching standard constructor is found That s correct because my MyFrameGrabber constructor looks like this MyFrameGrabber void x const std string amp y int z std string amp zz I tried to put in an empty constructor MyFrameGrabber but this results in a linker error Should I pass empty parameters to the MyFrameGrabber constructor in the singleton Or do I need to have a separate Hook Class and if yes how could I access MyFrameGrabber functions Thanks in advance SECOND EDIT 15 01 08 I applied the changes and it compiles and links now Unfortunately I cannot test this at runtime yet because it s a DLL and I have no Debug Caller Exe yet and there are other problems during initialization etc I will mark the post as answer because I m sure this is the right way to do this,cpp
I m looking for a library that will allow me to programatically modify Excel files to add data to certain cells My current idea is to use named ranges to determine where to insert the new data essentially a range of 1x1 then update the named ranges to point at the data The existing application this is going to integrate with is written entirely in C so I m ideally looking for a C solution hence why this thread is of limited usefulness If all else fails I ll go with a NET solution if there is some way of linking it against our C app An ideal solution would be open source but none of the ones I ve seen so far MyXls and XLSSTREAM seem up to the challenge I like the looks of Aspose Cells but it s for NET or Java not C and costs money I need to support all Excel formats from 97 through the present including the XLSX and XLSB formats Ideally it would also support formats such as OpenOffice and for output PDF and HTML Some use cases I need to support reading and modifying any cell in the spreadsheet including formulas creating reading modifying named ranges the ranges themselves not just the cells copying formatting from a cell to a bunch of others including conditional formatting we ll use one cell as a template for all the others we fill in with data Any help you can give me finding an appropriate library would be great I d also like to hear some testimonials about the various suggestions including the ones in my post so I can make more informed decisions what s easy to use bug free cheap etc,cpp
I have a web page with three dropdowns for day month and year If I use the JavaScript Date constructor that takes numbers then I get a Date object for my current timezone new Date xiYear xiMonth xiDate Give the correct date but it thinks that date is GMT 01 00 due to daylight savings time The problem here is that I then give this Date to an Ajax method and when the date is deserialised on the server it has been converted to GMT and so lost an hour which moves the day back by one Now I could just pass the day month and year individually into the Ajax method but it seems that there ought to be a better way The accepted answer pointed me in the right direction however just using setUTCHours by itself changed Apr 5th 00 00 GMT 01 00 to Apr 4th 23 00 GMT 01 00 I then also had to set the UTC date month and year to end up with Apr 5th 01 00 GMT 01 00 which is what I wanted,javascript
I m using boost for several C projects I recently made a upgrade 1 33 1 to 1 36 soon to 1 37 since then I cannot run any debug builds anymore To be sure that no other project issues remain I ve created a minimum test project which only includes boost thread and uses it to start one method The release build can be started the debug build cannot although the Dependency Walker shows that all required libraries are found this also means that the required MS Debug CRT is found in the SxS directory On startup I only get Die Anwendung konnte nicht richtig initialisiert werden 0xc0150002 Klicken Sie auf OK um die Anwendung zu beenden Which means nothing more than failed to initialize app An internet research primarily lead to an MS Office installation problem which recommends to perform a repair of WinXP So beside the repair setup which I think will not help as I m talking about debug dll issues any ideas Ah before I forget Absolutely the same source code leads to no errors on the build machine i e DLLs can be registered means executed So it s obviously an installation problem but as the DLLs are there and dependency walker finds it what else have I forgotten edit Well I have not yet resolved my problem but thanks to deemok I m a step further For the sake of reducing misunderstandings I give some clarifications below The program fails to run on the developer machine I am working with an installed VS2005 it s a VC 8 project I used the boost setup from BoostPro compiled all possible build versions and I double checked that they are there otherwise I d already get linker errors during build and I double checked any corner of include lib bin configuration I can think of as boost uses auto linking on windows with a special naming convention the build or start up would have failed with a much more comprehensible error message I cannot use static linking as boost thread requires dynamic linking for DLL projects I maybe could mess around here but as this problem seems to happen only on my machine I do not want to mess with this as I m sure the boost guys had a reason to place that check in there in the first place As I wrote I checked with Dependency Walker and it says everything is just fine Currently it seems to be an error in the boost dll maybe incorrect Manifest will check that,cpp

I often find myself writing a property that is evaluated lazily Something like if backingField null backingField SomeOperation return backingField It is not much code but it does get repeated a lot if you have a lot of properties I am thinking about defining a class called LazyProperty public class LazyProperty lt T gt private readonly Func lt T gt getter public LazyProperty Func lt T gt getter this getter getter private bool loaded false private T propertyValue public T Value get if loaded propertyValue getter loaded true return propertyValue public static implicit operator T LazyProperty lt T gt rhs return rhs Value This would enable me to initialize a field like this first new LazyProperty lt HeavyObject gt gt new HeavyObject MyProperty Value And then the body of the property could be reduced to public HeavyObject First get return first This would be used by most of the company since it would go into a common class library shared by most of our products I cannot decide whether this is a good idea or not I think the solutions has some pros like Less code Prettier code On the downside it would be harder to look at the code and determine exactly what happens especially if a developer is not familiar with the LazyProperty class What do you think Is this a good idea or should I abandon it Also is the implicit operator a good idea or would you prefer to use the Value property explicitly if you should be using this class Opinions and suggestions are welcomed,csharp
Is there any reason to prefer unicode somestring utf8 as opposed to somestring decode utf8 My only thought is that decode is a bound method so python may be able to resolve it more efficiently but correct me if I m wrong,python

Is it possible to use the with statement directly with CSV files It seems natural to be able to do something like this import csv with csv reader open myfile csv as reader do things with reader But csv reader doesn t provide the __enter__ and __exit__ methods so this doesn t work I can however do it in two steps import csv with open myfile csv as f reader csv reader f do things with reader Is this second way the ideal way to do it Why wouldn t they make csv reader directly compatible with the with statement,python
I hate the JavaBeans pattern with a passion that burns like the fire of a thousand suns Why Verbose It s 2009 I shouldn t have to write 7 LOC for a property If they have event listeners then hold on to your hat No type safe references There is no type safe way to reference a property The whole point of Java is that it is type safe and its most popular pattern is not at all typesafe What I would like is something like class Customer public Property lt String gt name new Property I am a web developer mostly so it needs JPA and Wicket support Help me off the javabean train,java
I m trying to parse a date time string using DateTime ParseExact It works everywhere except on one machine it just will not parse on that machine The question is Why What could be different on that machine so that it will cause this behaviour Here are some things that I ve already looked at The CultureInfo is passed to DateTime ParseExact namely CultureInfo InvariantCulture The regional settings on the rogue machine is the same as the settings on a machine where the parsing works Yes the string is in the correct format which is dd MM yyyy HH mm ss,csharp
Well I ve been given an assignment to basically figure out how memory allocation works for whatever language I ll be using After some research I have some questions and doubts which I d like to get some insight in For example I read here that Java specifies exactly how the stack contents are organized Looking at the JVM spec structure it basically says the stack contains frames and that the frames contain whatever is inside the class by properly allocating the variables and functions Maybe I am missing something here but I don t understand how this is any different than what C does I ask because the first link says Java s specification of stack contents avoid compiler incompatibilities Also I have yet to find how the memory segments are exactly organized on top of each other For example I know the memory is divided into global variables call stack heap and code for C yet I don t know if the heap s address is higher than the stack s or if that depends on the implementation I also wonder whether a Java program has more than that and how it would be laid out as well I imagine there is a standard since the JVM has to know where it all is to use it though I suppose it could just have the pointers and leave the rest to the OS I imagine too that there must be at least a de facto standard Another the thing I don t understand is the runtime constant pool It s supposed to be a per class or per interface runtime representation of the constant_pool table in a class file but I don t think I understand what it does It seems to have a tag to indicate what type the structure in question is Then the name of the structure given by the programmer or assigned by the underlying system Then it seems the rest of it varies with whatever the tag describes a thread an array etc If my interpretation of the runtime constant pool is right then why are they necessary as well as stack frames Is it because stack frames only take care of the stack segments and the runtime constant pool must also have pointers for the heap allocated memory,java

My question seems easy but is little more theoretical than it looks There are Code Generation software or application building software that gets done without the use of a programming language Application like VE Server and VE Designer from Intelliun should accomplish this task My question is in reality have someone out there track the amount of real savings of this kind of tool versus having a development team and a source code evolutionary process For the specific example of VE Designer the application gets done from the designer and you don t see code for it you just run the app in VE Server All code looks like XML Internal commands,java
Compiler error CS0283 indicates that only the basic POD types as well as strings enums and null references can be declared as const Does anyone have a theory on the rationale for this limitation For instance it would be nice to be able to declare const values of other types such as IntPtr I believe that the concept of const is actually syntactic sugar in C and that it just replaces any uses of the name with the literal value For instance given the following declaration any reference to Foo would be replaced with foo at compile time const string Foo foo This would rule out any mutable types so maybe they chose this limitation rather than having to determine at compile time whether a given type is mutable,csharp

For those of you with experience with both what are the major differences For a newcomer to either which would be better to learn Are there situations where you might choose C but then other situations where you would choose C Is it a case of use the best tool for the job or one is significantly better than the other I know C is an enhancement of C but it was created in 83 and hasn t completely replaced C so there must be something more to it I know this question is subjective and I am not trying to start any religious war so please try to be as objective as possible Clear strengths and weaknesses and comparisons,cpp

I was writing a toString for a class in Java the other day by manually writing out each element of the class to a String and it occurred to me that using reflection it might be possible to create a generic toString method that could work on ALL classes I E it would figure out the field names and values and send them out to a String Getting the field names is fairly simple here is what a co worker came up with public static List initFieldArray String className throws ClassNotFoundException Class c Class forName className Field field c getFields List lt String gt classFields new ArrayList field length for int i 0 i lt field length i String cf field i toString classFields add cf substring cf lastIndexOf 1 return classFields Using a factory I could reduce the performance overhead by storing the fields once the first time the toString is called However finding the values could be a lot more expensive Due to the performance of reflection this may be more hypothetical then practical But I am interested in the idea of reflection and how I can use it to improve my everyday programming,java

In many situations JavaScript parsers will insert semicolons for you if you leave them out My question is do you leave them out If you re unfamiliar with the rules there s a description of semicolon insertion on the Mozilla site Here s the key point If the first through the nth tokens of a JavaScript program form are grammatically valid but the first through the n 1st tokens are not and there is a line break between the nth tokens and the n 1st tokens then the parser tries to parse the program again after inserting a virtual semicolon token between the nth and the n 1st tokens That description may be incomplete because it doesn t explain Dreas s example Anybody have a link to the complete rules or see why the example gets a semicolon I tried it in JScript NET This stackoverflow question is related but only talks about a specific scenario,javascript
I ve been using javascript for a while but have never learned the language past the basics I am reading John Resig s Pro Javascript Techniques I m coming up with some questions but I m not finding the answers to them in the book or on google etc John gives this example in his book Function 1 function User name age this name name this age age Add a new function to the object prototype User prototype getName function return this name User prototype getAge function return this age var user new User Bob 44 console log User user getName Age user getAge I m still learning about the prototype property so I tried writing something similar Function 2 function User name age this name name this age age this getName function return this name this getAge function return this age var user new User Bob 44 console log User user getName Age user getAge It doesn t use the prototype property to create the getName and getAge functions but the output is the same as John s example I took it one step further and created this Function 3 var User name age 0 setName function name this name name setAge function age this age age getName function return this name getAge function return this age User setName Bob User setAge 44 console log User User getName Age User getAge Again it looks different than John s example and I had to add setter methods but the output is the same Question 1 what is the difference between the 3 functions What is the advantage of the prototype property and is Function 2 doing anything incorrectly because it seems more straight forward to code 2 instead of 1 although I m sure 1 is doing it better seeing as John created it Question 2 How could I modify function 3 to not use the setName and setAge methods but still keep the shorthand Can the shorthand have constructors Thanks in advance for helping me learn EDIT I think my 2nd question was a little confusing I meant how could I use the shorthand to create a User object but then after I create the object say something like var user new User Bob 44 Just like in Function 1 or is that not possible EDIT 2 Wow Thanks everyone for the awesome answers That really makes it a lot more clear to me So if I understand correctly the difference between 1 and 2 aren t too much If I only ever create one User object they probably aren t different at all But if my program creates many User objects 1 would most likely be more efficient and use less memory since all objects will share the same functions I really appreciate all of the great answers Thanks,javascript

I want to put two lt div gt s next to each other The right lt div gt is about 200px and the left lt div gt must fill up the rest of the screen width How can I do this,html
EDIT Oops as rightly pointed out there d be no way to know whether the constructor for the class in question is sensitive to when or how many times it is called or whether the object s state is changed during the method so it would have to be created from scratch each time Ignore the Dictionary and just consider delegates created in line during the course of a method Say I have the following method with Dictionary of Type to Action local variable void TakeAction Type type Random types chosen for example var actions new Dictionary lt Type Action gt typeof StringBuilder gt typeof DateTime gt actions type Invoke The Dictionary will always be the same when the method is called Can the C compiler notice this only create it once and cache it somewhere for use in future calls to the method Or will it simply be created from scratch each time I know it could be a field of the containing class but it seems neater to me for a thing like this to be contained in the method that uses it,csharp

Ok have a bunch of questions that I have been thinking about the past few days Currently I have a site that is just a bunch of PHP files with MySQL statements mixed in with PHP HTML and CSS basically a huge mess I have been tasked with cleaning up the site and have made for myself the following requirements The site needs to be efficient and well laid out the source code I would like to be able to write as little code as possible There has to be good separation between structure presentation and logic For whatever reason I can t use a framework and need to keep the code maintainable and simple as there will be future developers working with it There needs to be an admin section for at least a few pages Saying that this is what I know about the site as it is now Consists of 10 12 pages a few are completely static most are dynamically driven via a database and there is a huge form for users to fill out 20 30 fields that need to be validated and checked The hierarchy of the site is basically 5 6 main pages and then sub pages within those So knowing those things I wanted to know if anyone had any tips suggestions as to how to go about doing this with the least amount of headaches Would an OO approach be best in this situation Since there are many static pages and the dynamic pages just need the content filled in would it be best to use some kind of basic template EDIT Thanks for the answers when I said no frameworks I basically meant anything that would require new syntax other than PHP as whoever gets hired to work on this site after me will probably only know PHP,php

Ok this is a little complex I am creating a plugin and want to find the category ID from the Post page That s the easy part What makes it complex is I am doing it within an ob_start started in a template_redirect action as I want to edit the full page before it is returned to the browser Again that is easy enough from the ob_start function With the ID returned I want to evaluate some php stored in a sql field I am trying to do this from within the ob_start function tui_cifp_insertvalue tui_cifp_evaluate_html tui_cifp_insertvalue This calls this function tui_cifp_evaluate_html string return preg_replace_callback lt php lt lt php gt si EvalBuffer string Which in turn calls function EvalBuffer string ob_start eval string 2 ret ob_get_contents ob_end_clean return ret And the php I am trying to evaluate is lt php tui_findPostThumbIMG categoryID 100 100 categoryintro thumbnail gt This all works outside the ob_start routine but here even simple php doesn t work From within the ob_start routine the plugin breaks and a blank page returns So I thought I could evaluate the php before the start of the ob_start and pass the result through a global variable That works but at the point this starts using the following the category ID is not available if strpos _SERVER REQUEST_URI wp admin false global holdvalue tui_cifp_insertvalue get_option tui_cifp_insertvalue categories get_the_category categoryID categories 0 gt cat_ID tui_cifp_insertvalue str_replace categoryID categoryID tui_cifp_insertvalue holdvalue tui_cifp_evaluate_html tui_cifp_insertvalue add_action template_redirect tui_cifp_ob_start The ob_start function function tui_cifp_ob_start ob_start tui_cifp_templatefilter Ok I am stumped any ideas I either need to find a hook that executes at the right time so that I have access to the category ID or I need to work out how to evaluate the php during the ob_start Oh I guess I should say What I want to do is replace a tag on a wordpress page with some other information saved in a string but need to be able to do this once the full page if drawn Thanks Stephen PS I have asked this on the wordpress forums without a response Sorry for the cross posting but I am a little desperate,php
I ve got a web application that controls which web applications get served traffic from our load balancer The web application runs on each individual server It keeps track of the in or out state for each application in an object in the ASP NET application state and the object is serialized to a file on the disk whenever the state is changed The state is deserialized from the file when the web application starts While the site itself only gets a couple requests a second tops and the file it rarely accessed I ve found that it was extremely easy for some reason to get collisions while attempting to read from or write to the file This mechanism needs to be extremely reliable because we have an automated system that regularly does rolling deployments to the server Before anyone makes any comments questioning the prudence of any of the above allow me to simply say that explaining the reasoning behind it would make this post much longer than it already is so I d like to avoid moving mountains That said the code that I use to control access to the file looks like this internal static Mutex _lock null lt summary gt Executes the specified lt see cref Func FileStream Object gt delegate on the filesystem copy of the lt see cref ServerState gt The work done on the file is wrapped in a lock statement to ensure there are no locking collisions caused by attempting to save and load the file simultaneously from separate requests lt summary gt lt param name action gt The logic to be executed on the lt see cref ServerState gt file lt param gt lt returns gt An object containing any result data returned by lt param name func gt lt returns gt private static Boolean InvokeOnFile Func lt FileStream Object gt func out Object result var l new Logger if ServerState _lock WaitOne 1500 false l LogInformation Got lock to read write file based server state Int32 VipEvent GotStateLock var fileStream File Open ServerState PATH FileMode OpenOrCreate FileAccess ReadWrite FileShare None result func Invoke fileStream fileStream Close fileStream Dispose fileStream null ServerState _lock ReleaseMutex l LogInformation Released state file lock Int32 VipEvent ReleasedStateLock return true else l LogWarning Could not get a lock to access the file based server state Int32 VipEvent CouldNotGetStateLock result null return false This usually works but occasionally I cannot get access to the mutex I see the Could not get a lock event in the log I cannot reproduce this locally it only happens on my production servers Win Server 2k3 IIS 6 If I remove the timeout the application hangs indefinitely race condition including on subsequent requests When I do get the errors looking at the event log tells me that the mutex lock was achieved and released by the previous request before the error was logged The mutex is instantiated in the Application_Start event I get the same results when it is instantiated statically in the declaration Excuses excuses threading locking is not my fort    as I generally don t have to worry about it Any suggestions as to why it randomly would fail to get a signal Update I ve added proper error handling how embarrassing but I am still getting the same errors and for the record unhandled exceptions were never the problem Only one process would ever be accessing the file I don t use a web garden for this application s web pool and no other applications use the file The only exception I can think of would be when the app pool recycles and the old WP is still open when the new one is created but I can tell from watching the task manager that the issue occurs while there is only one worker process mmr How is using Monitor any different from using a Mutex Based on the MSDN documentation it looks like it is effectively doing the same thing if and I can t get the lock with my Mutex it does fail gracefully by just returning false Another thing to note The issues I m having seem to be completely random if it fails on one request it might work fine on the next There doesn t seem to be a pattern either certainly no every other at least Update 2 This lock is not used for any other call The only time _lock is referenced outside the InvokeOnFile method is when it is instantiated The Func that is invoked is either reading from the file and deserializing into an object or serializing an object and writing it to the file Neither operation is done on a separate thread ServerState PATH is a static readonly field which I don t expect would cause any concurrency problems I d also like to re iterate my earlier point that I cannot reproduce this locally in Cassini Lessons learned Use proper error handling duh Use the right tool for the job and have a basic understanding of what how that tool does As sambo points out using a Mutex apparently has a lot of overhead which was causing issues in my application whereas Monitor is designed specifically for NET,csharp

I was wondering if anyone knows about a good article which describes dividing workload on to several Threads Preferebly it would be written for C but it s really the concept I m after so it s not an issue if it s written for a different similar language I have a problem where I would have to divide a large amount of computing into several threads and then Sum the generated data after one iteration completes so I would need to know that all threads have finished and then start a new iteration supplying all the threads with the data generated in the last iteration the data would be modified before the end of each iteration I hope this makes sense and is possible Either way I would appreciate some advice on how to tackle the problem of computing large amounts of data divided on to several threads so I can use more than one processor s core Thank you for your answers,csharp

For small sets or maps it s usually much faster to just use a sorted vector instead of the tree based set map especially for something like 5 10 elements LLVM has some classes in that spirit but no real adapter that would provide a std map like interface backed up with a std vector Any free implementation of this out there Edit Thanks for all the alternative ideas but I m really interested in a vector based set map I do have specific cases where I tend to create huge amounts of sets maps which contain usually less than 10 elements and I do really want to have less memory pressure Think about for example neighbor edges for a vertex in a triangle mesh you easily wind up with 100k sets of 3 4 elements each,cpp

Hey I am trying to get an iframe B communicate with site A I ve searched and searched and every thing I read says it s impossible if they are of different domain the iframe src is coming from a sub domain I want to communicate because my company has ads on its page and it needs to refresh them every X minutes This is ok if it s a normal add but some adds extend Like I have adds that start with 300x250 and then get to 800x300 I wanted to communicate to the iframe to know when the add was going to expand but it just doesn t seem to be a way Is there any way to let the add go beyond the initial size of the iframe If the add is 300x250 the iframe will also have 300x250 but when the add expands it get s cut off so I really need to either get the iframe to expand also or have the add go beyond the size of the iframe Anyone know how to do this or have some tutorial that shows how to have some basic communication to an iframe Note There are some websites that also serve adds that have a totally different domain so it would be great if someone knew how to make it go beyond the iframe Thanks,html

I recently needed to serialize a datatable to JSON Where I m at we re still on Net 2 0 so I can t use the JSON serializer in Net 3 5 I figured this must have been done before so I went looking online and found a number of different options Some of them depend on an additional library which I would have a hard time pushing through here Others require first converting to List lt Dictionary lt gt gt which seemed a little awkward and needless Another treated all values like a string For one reason or another I couldn t really get behind any of them so I decided to roll my own which is posted below As you can see from reading the TODO comments it s incomplete in a few places This code is already in production here so it does work in the basic sense The places where it s incomplete are places where we know our production data won t currently hit it no timespans or byte arrays in the db The reason I m posting here is that I feel like this can be a little better and I d like help finishing and improving this code Any input welcome Note that this capability is built into Net 3 5 and later and so the only reason to use this code today is if you re still limited to Net 2 0 Even then JSON Net has become the goto library for this kind of thing public static class JSONHelper public static string FromDataTable DataTable dt string rowDelimiter StringBuilder result new StringBuilder foreach DataRow row in dt Rows result Append rowDelimiter result Append FromDataRow row rowDelimiter result Append return result ToString public static string FromDataRow DataRow row DataColumnCollection cols row Table Columns string colDelimiter StringBuilder result new StringBuilder for int i 0 i lt cols Count i use index rather than foreach so we can use the index for both the row and cols collection result Append colDelimiter Append Append cols i ColumnName Append Append JSONValueFromDataRowObject row i cols i DataType colDelimiter result Append return result ToString possible types http msdn microsoft com en us library system data datacolumn datatype VS 80 aspx private static Type numeric new Type typeof byte typeof decimal typeof double typeof Int16 typeof Int32 typeof SByte typeof Single typeof UInt16 typeof UInt32 typeof UInt64 I don t want to rebuild this value for every date cell in the table private static long EpochTicks new DateTime 1970 1 1 Ticks private static string JSONValueFromDataRowObject object value Type DataType null if value DBNull Value return null numeric if Array IndexOf numeric DataType gt 1 return value ToString TODO eventually want to use a stricter format Specifically separate integral types from floating types and use the R round trip format specifier boolean if DataType typeof bool return bool value true false date see http weblogs asp net bleroy archive 2008 01 18 dates and json aspx if DataType typeof DateTime return Date new TimeSpan DateTime value ToUniversalTime Ticks EpochTicks TotalMilliseconds ToString TODO add Timespan support TODO add Byte support TODO this would be _much_ faster with a state machine TODO way to select between double or single quote literal encoding TODO account for database strings that may have single r or n line breaks string char return value ToString Replace Replace Environment NewLine n Replace Update This is old now but I wanted to point out something about how this code handles dates The format I used made sense at the time for the exact rationale in the url However that rationale includes the following To be perfectly honest JSON Schema does solve the problem by making it possible to subtype a string as a date literal but this is still work in progress and it will take time before any significant adoption is reached Well time has passed Today it s okay to just use the ISO 8601 date format I m not gonna bother changing the code cause really this is ancient Just go use JSON Net,csharp

I was looking at the builtin object methods in the Python documentation and I was interested in the documentation for object __repr__ self Here s what it says Called by the repr built in function and by string conversions reverse quotes to compute the       official      string representation of an object If at all possible this should look like a valid Python expression that could be used to recreate an object with the same value given an appropriate environment If this is not possible a string of the form lt some useful description should be returned The return value must be a string object If a class defines repr but not str then repr is also used when an       informal      string representation of instances of that class is required This is typically used for debugging so it is important that the representation is information rich and unambiguous The most interesting part to me was If at all possible this should look like a valid Python expression that could be used to recreate an object with the same value but I m not sure exactly what this means It says it should look like an expression which can be used to recreate the object but does that mean it should just be an example of the sort of expression you could use or should it be an actual expression that can be executed eval etc to recreate the object Or should it be just a rehasing of the actual expression which was used for pure information purposes In general I m a bit confused as to exactly what I should be putting here,python
I have a base class Foo that has an Update function which I want to be called once per frame for every instance of that class Given an object instance of this class called foo then once per frame I will call foo Update I have a class Bar derived from my base class that also needs to update every frame I could give the derived class an Update function but then I would have to remember to call its base Update function nothing enforces my requirement that the base Update function is called because I have overriden it and could easily just forget to or choose not to call the base Update function So as an alternative I could give the base class a protected OnUpdate function which could be made overrideable and call it from the base Update function This removes the onus on me to remember to call base Update from the derived update function because I m no longer overriding it A Bar instance called bar will have bar Update called on it this will first call the base class Update method which will in turn call the overriden OnUpdate function performing the derived class necessary updates Which solves everything Except What if I want to derive yet another updatable class this time from the Bar class Baz which derives from Bar also has update requirements If I put them in Baz s OnUpdate function I m back to the original problem in that I d have to remember to tell Baz s OnUpdate function to call Bar s OnUpdate function otherwise Bar s OnUpdate function wouldn t get called So really I d want Bar s OnUpdate function to be non overridable and instead for it to call an overridable function after it has done whatever it needed to do perhaps called OnUpdate2 And if I wanted to derive yet another class OnUpdate3 OnUpdate4 AfterUpdate Is there a Better Way Further Info My specific problem domain is a 3d world I ve decided my base class is a Locator an object with a location and orientation My first derived class is a PhysicsObject a Locator that also has mass velocity collision information etc My next derived class is a Camera which derives from PhysicsObject As well as position and velocity it also has information about the viewport depth of field etc MattK suggests simplifying the hierarchy if a Locator is never referred to incorporate it into PhysicsObject I m also thinking about how I would go about turning the layout upside down and using composition instead of inheritance Perhaps a Camera HAS physics properties Perhaps a PhysicsObject HAS a location I ll have to think some more about this problem I like Uri s approach Observe the contract Here s the rule please follow it Uri is right in that whatever kind of safeguards I try to put in anyone could circumvent them so perhaps in this case the simplest solution is best All my update functions are going to have the requirement of calling their base update function Thanks for the help everyone,cpp

I m preparing to go to a computer science contest by completing problems from past contests Most of them are pretty easy but this one is bugging me it seems simple but I m just not being able to do it If you have a string of ones and zeros 100111010001111100101010 What would be the code to take that as an input and then output this 1 1 2 0 3 1 1 0 1 1 3 0 5 1 2 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 Where the digit to the left of each colon is the number of times the digit after the colon appears So another example inputting 1100011 Would output 2 1 3 0 2 1 According to the problem this is similar to the algorithm used to compress fax transmissions An answer in java would be best but all I m really looking for is pseudocode or even thoughts on how to do it Thanks in advance,java

I m developing a LoB application in Java after a long absence from the platform having spent the last 8 years or so entrenched in Fortran C a smidgin of C and latterly Net Java the language is not much changed from how I remember it I like it s strengths and I can work around its weaknesses the platform has grown and deciding upon the myriad of different frameworks which appear to do much the same thing as one another is a different story but that can wait for another day all in all I m comfortable with Java However over the last couple of weeks I ve become enamoured with Groovy and purely from a selfish point of view but not just because it makes development against the JVM a more succinct and entertaining and well groovy proposition than Java the language What strikes me most about Groovy is its inherent maintainability We all I hope strive to write well documented easy to understand code However sometimes the languages we use themselves defeat us An example in 2001 I wrote a library in C to translate EDIFACT EDI messages into ANSI X12 messages This is not a particularly complicated process if slightly involved and I thought at the time I had documented the code properly and I probably had but some six years later when I revisited the project and after becoming acclimatised to C I found myself lost in so much C boilerplate mallocs pointers etc etc that it took three days of thoughtful analysis before I finally understood what I d been doing six years previously This evening I ve written about 2000 lines of Java it is the day of rest after all I ve documented as best as I know how but but of those 2000 lines of Java a significant proportion is Java boiler plate This is where I see Groovy and other dynamic languages winning through maintainability and later comprehension Groovy lets you concentrate on your intent without getting bogged down on the platform specific implementation it s almost but not quite self documenting I see this as being a huge boon to me when I revisit my current project which I ll port to Groovy asap in several years time and to my successors who will inherit it and carry on the good work So are there any reasons not to use Groovy,java
We have an application that runs over load balanced server instances and therefore is configured to use the ASP NET session state service which is running on one of our DB servers While both instances of our app can successfully connect to the state server changes in session state data are not being reflected across both of them FI If I call Session Add SomeKey SomeData on Server A this is not being reflected if I then try to access Session SomeKey on Server B Session SessionID returns the same value on both servers and I have checked that they are both using the same validationkey and decryptionkey values configured in the machinekey section of machine config I even tried specifying these values in the apps web config What other things should I be looking out for which may be causing these symptoms and what steps can people recommend to help debug this issue,csharp
In C the following code gives a compiler error void destruct1 int item item gt int This code is nearly the same I just typedef the int to another type and something magic happens typedef int myint void destruct2 myint item item gt myint Why does the second code works Does an int gets a destructor just because it has been typedefed In case you wonder why one ever would like to do this This comes from refactoring C code We re removing the standard heap and replacing it with selfmade pools This requires us to call placement new and the destructors I know that calling destructors for primitive types is useless but we want them in the code nevertheless in case we later replace PODs with real classes Finding out that naked int s don t work but typedefed ones do was quite a surprise Btw I have a solution that involves template functions We just typedef inside the template and everything is fine,cpp
There are lots of places where guidelines for designing exception classes can be found Almost everywhere I look there s this list of things exception objects should never do which impacts the design of those classes For instance the Boost people recommend that the class contain no std string members because their constructor could throw which would cause the run time to terminate the program immediately Now it seems to me that this is rather theoretical If std string s constructor throws it s either a bug I passed a null pointer in or an out of memory condition correct me if I m wrong here Since I m on a desktop I just pretend I have an infinite amount of memory and running out of memory is fatal to my application no matter what With that in mind why shouldn t I embed std string objects in my exception classes In fact why couldn t my exception classes be full featured and also take care of logging stack tracing etc I m aware of the one responsibility principle and it seems to me to be a fair trade off to have the exception class do all that Surely if my parser needs to report a syntax error an full featured exception would be more helpful than an exception built around a statically allocated character array So lean C exception classes how big a deal is it in the real world What are the trade offs Are there good discussions on the topic,cpp

I have a net library dll that acts like a functional library There are a bunch of static types along with static methods There is some initialization code that I need to run to set up the library ready for use When the assembly gets loaded is there a way to ensure that a particular method is run Something like AppDomain AssemblyLoad but called automatically from the assembly itself I was thinking that maybe there is something like an AssemblyAttribute that could be used At the moment I have this initialization code in a static constructor but as this is a library with many entry points there is no guarantee that this particular type will be used Thanks,csharp

I ve recently started work on a new project using PHP5 and want to use their PDO classes for it The problem is that the MySQL PDO Driver doesn t support rowCount so there s no way to run a query and then get the number of affected rows or rows returned which is a pretty big issue as far as I m concerned I was wondering if anyone else has dealt with this before and what you ve done to work around it Having to do a fetch or fetchAll to check if any rows were affected or returned seems like a hack to me I d rather just do stmt numRows or something similar,php
I notice sometimes users mistype their email address in a contact us form for example typing yahho com yhoo com or yahoo co instead of yahoo com I feel that this can be corrected on the spot with some javascript Simply check the email address for possible mistakes such as the ones listed above so that if the user types his_email yhoo com a non obtrusive message can be displayed or something like that suggesting that he probably means yahoo com and asking to double check he typed his email correctly The Question is How can I detect in java script that a string is very similar to yahoo or yahoo com or in general how can I detect the level of similarity between two strings P S this is a side note In my specific case the users are not native English speakers and most of them are no where near fluent the site itself is not in English,javascript

I m developing a media bookmarking site and am looking for a way to remember whether a user has bookmarked an item without having to go to the DB every page load to check I haven t used PHP sessions before but I m thinking they would do the trick Would it make sense to do an initial DB call when the user logs in grab all the items that a user has bookmarked and save an array of all the item ids to the user session Then when a page is loaded for each of the 100 items on the page it would check whether that item s ID is in the session array so we know whether to display the bookmark button or an indicator that they ve already bookmarked it Just want to make sure this is a right strategy or if there is a better way Would this work fine even if there are 10 000 ids in the array,php

I m a NET web developer who has just been asked to produce a small demo website using NetBeans IDE 5 5 I have no experience with Java up to this point I ve followed a couple of quick tutorials one which just uses a JSP file and another which uses a servlet My concern at this early stage is that it looks difficult to keep my application code away from my markup Using JSP files looks quite similar to the old days of classic ASP On the other hand servlets look useful but seem to involve a lot of writing out markup to the output stream which I m not happy with either Is there an equivalent to the ASP NET code behind model or any other strategies for separating out markup and code Is it possible to keep markup in the JSP and then use the servlet from the JSP,java

I d like to express in an HTML document what kind of document is pointed by an anchor tag lt a gt For example is it a list of dates or a list of people etc All referenced documents will be Atom feeds but the links will be displayed differently based on what the feed contains I see 2 options using the rel attribute this attribute is supposed to contains the relation between the current document and the referenced document I don t think this is an optimal solution as this attribute is supposed to define the relation and not really the content The referenced document will be a list of dates for all documents referencing it using the type attribute this attribute is supposed to contains the content type of the referenced document This solution seems closer to what I try to achieve but this attribute should contains a content type and not a more generic description of the link Which solution would you recommend Do you see a cleaner way to achieve the same result,html

First off I know this is probably a tall order but We have some software that interacts with the hardware our company produces This software loads a NET assembly and this acts as our interface to the hardware Currently we have a Launcher application written in C which provides role based security This Launcher launches the C executable with command line arguments the NET assembly to use via a process The C executable then loads the supplied NET assembly and uses it to perform its actions The problem is because I launch the C application in a process I lose the role based security context provided by the Launcher Is there any way I can launch the C application and keep the role based security context Thanks for taking the time to read this If you have any questions please let me know Thank you Adam,csharp

I could be totally wrong here but as I understand it C doesn t really have a native pointer to member function type I know you can do tricks with Boost and mem_fun etc But why did the designers of C decide not to have a 64 bit pointer containing a pointer to the function and a pointer to the object for example What I mean specifically is a pointer to a member function of a particular object of unknown type I E something you can use for a callback This would be a type which contains two values The first value being a pointer to the function and the second value being a pointer to the specific instance of the object What I do not mean is a pointer to a general member function of a class E G int Fred char float It would have been so useful and made my life easier Hugo,cpp

I m making a script parser in python and I m a little stuck I am not quite sure how to parse a line for all its functions or even just one function at a time and then search for a function with that name and if it exists execute that function short of writing a massive list if elif else block EDIT This is for my own scripting language that i m making its nothing very complex but i have a standard library of 8 functions or so that i need to be able to be run how can i parse a line and run the function named in the line,python
We wrote a small Windows class library that implements extension methods for some standard types strings initially I placed this in a library so that any of our projects would be able to make use of it by simply referencing it and adding using XXX Extensions A problem came up when we wanted to use some of these methods in Silverlight Although all the code was compatible a Windows library can t be referenced in Silverlight so we created a Silverlight library that had links to the same class files and put compiler directives into the classes to allow different using declarations and namespaces This worked fine until today when I added a new class to the Windows extensions library and realised that I would have to remember to link the class into the Silverlight library too This isn t ideal and I wondered if anyone might have ideas for a better way of sharing extension methods and other helper code between Windows and Silverlight projects,csharp

I rewrite URLs to include the title of user generated travelblogs I do this for both readability of URLs and SEO purposes http www example com gallery 280 Gorges_du_Todra The first integer is the id the rest is for us humans but is irrelevant for requesting the resource Now people can write titles containing any UTF 8 character but most are not allowed in the URL My audience is generally English speaking but since they travel they like to include names like A    t Ben Haddou What is the proper way to translate this for displaying in an URL using PHP on linux So far I ve seen several solutions just strip all non allowed characters replace spaces this has strange results A    t Ben Haddou       gallery 280 At_Ben_Haddou Not really helpfull just strip all non allowed characters replace spaces leave charcode stackoverflow com most likely because of the regex hammer used this gives strange results t    st t    st       questions 0000 t233st t233st translate to nearest equivalent A    t Ben Haddou       gallery 280 Ait_Ben_Haddou But this goes wrong for german for example     should be transliterated ue For me as a Dutch person the 3rd result looks the best I m quite sure however that 1 many people will have a different opinion and 2 it is just plain wrong in the german example Another problem with the 3rd option is how to find all possible characters that can be converted to a 7bit equivalent So the question is what in your opinion is the most desirable result within tech limits How to technically solve it reach the desired result with PHP,php

I know this should be simple and I should know it but it s eluding me for the time being I am using a singleton pattern to help with logging stuff However logging only happens in one class and the singleton is basically a watcher for a boolean that opens and closes the log file Because I don t want the file to be opened more than once or closed more than once I m using the singleton pattern However I don t want it to be a global value and I sure as hell don t want other classes even inside the package accessing it How can I make it so only this one class use it,csharp
My degree is in Electrical and Computer Engineering but i m currently employed as a Software Engineer I took all of the algebra geometry and calculus classes that one would expect from someone with my degree however I must admit I think I learned just enough to pass the test but never really saw a use for it and therefore never really retained much of the material Now that i ve matured some I see the use for it all of the time I KNOW that there are lots of places that math knowledge would improve my coding so i m ready to relearn the old stuff and learn some new stuff What are your favorite resources out there Resources that can tie math into programming are even better if you have any Books Websites Blogs,cpp

I am using VS 2008 and get compiler errors sporadically when adding a dll reference to a managed c file in my C project I am trying to add a reference to the dll so as to be able to use smart pointers ex import items tlb The problem is that the compiler crashes at sporadic places inside of items tlh almost as though chunks of bytes where erased of missings but when i open the file i can t find any reference to the aforementioned errors I tried to rebuild the whole project several times tried on different machine but although the compiler errors are not consistents and disappear alltogether sometimes a fresh rebuild sometimes brings back the problem I was told that the size of the generated tlh file may be a reason but it doesn t really solve my problem or point me in the right direction Did anybody experienced the same symptoms Thank you,cpp
In Python compiled regex patterns have a findall method that does the following Return all non overlapping matches of pattern in string as a list of strings The string is scanned left to right and matches are returned in the order found If one or more groups are present in the pattern return a list of groups this will be a list of tuples if the pattern has more than one group Empty matches are included in the result unless they touch the beginning of another match What s the canonical way of doing this in Perl A naive algorithm I can think of is along the lines of while a search and replace with the empty string is successful do suite I m hoping there s a nicer way Thanks in advance,python

A little background I m creating a set of adapters to allow communication with mobile devices over different cellular networks This will be achieved using a class factory pattern At least one of the networks requires a service reference to communicate with their devices through a web service So far I ve got 3 assemblies so far which represent An assembly which contains the main adapter library this contains The interface definition for each of the adapters Base classes The class factory to instantiate the specified adapter at runtime An assembly for each network adapter implementation An assembly that contains my main application Given that I don t want to be adding service references and their configuration to the main application assembly as that s not relevant to the main application how do I force each assembly s service reference to get its configuration from its own app config If I have the service reference configuration in the main app config everything works just fine but if I move the configuration to the adapter s app config everything stops working throwing the following exception at the point where I new up the Soap1Client Could not find default endpoint element that references contract MobileService Service1Soap in the ServiceModel client configuration section This might be because no configuration file was found for your application or because no endpoint element matching this contract could be found in the client element,csharp

The NET Console class and its default TextWriter implementation available as Console Out and implicitly in e g Console WriteLine does not signal any error when the application is having its output piped to another program and the other program terminates or closes the pipe before the application has finished This means that the application may run for longer than necessary writing output into a black hole How can I detect the closing of the other end of the redirection pipe A more detailed explanation follows Here are a pair of example programs that demonstrate the problem Produce prints lots of integers fairly slowly to simulate the effect of computation using System class Produce static void Main for int i 0 i lt 10000 i System Threading Thread Sleep 100 added for effect Console WriteLine i Consume only reads the first 10 lines of input and then exits using System class Consume static void Main for int i 0 i lt 10 i Console ReadLine If these two programs are compiled and the output of the first piped to the second like so Produce Consume it can be observed that Produce keeps on running long after Consume has terminated In reality my Consume program is Unix style head and my Produce program prints data which is costly to calculate I d like to terminate output when the other end of the pipe has closed the connection How can I do this in NET I know that an obvious alternative is to pass a command line argument to limit output and indeed that s what I m currently doing but I d still like to know how to do this since I want to be able to make more configurable judgements about when to terminate reading e g piping through grep before head UPDATE It looks horribly like the System IO __ConsoleStream implementation in NET is hard coded to ignore errors 0x6D ERROR_BROKEN_PIPE and 0xE8 ERROR_NO_DATA That probably means I need to reimplement the console stream Sigh,csharp

In Python if I want my server to scale well CPU wise I obviously need to spawn multiple processes I was wondering which is better using Twisted A The manager process the one who holds the actual socket connections puts received packets into a shared queue the one from the multiprocessing module and worker processes pull the packets out of the queue process them and send the results back to the client B The manager process the one who holds the actual socket connections launches a deferred thread and then calls the apply function on the process pool Once the result returns from the worker process the manager sends the result back to the client In both implementations the worker processes use thread pools so they can work on more than one packet at once since there will be a lot of database querying,python

I need to set a single property in a jQuery command using a value that is calculated in the code behind My initial thought was to just use lt gt to access it like this aspx lt script type text javascript language javascript gt sparklines sparkline html fillColor transparent normalRangeMin 0 normalRangeMax lt NormalRangeMax gt lt script gt aspx cs protected string NormalRangeMax Calculate the value It smells odd to have to call from the ASPX page to just get a single value though Not to mention I have an entire method that does a small calculation just to populate a single property One alternative would be to create the entire lt script gt block in the code behind using clientScriptManager RegisterClientScriptBlock But I really don t like putting entire chunks of JavaScript in the code behind since its well JavaScript Maybe if I end up having many of these methods I can just put then in a partial class so at least they are physically separate from the rest of the code What method would you recommend as being easy to understand and easy to maintain,jquery

For simplicity i have the following file named test jsp lt script language javascript gt alert a b replace g k lt script gt I put this file in my local server then display it using firefox http localhost 8080 myproj test jsp It works okay the result alert string is akb But when i put this file in a remote server and use the same firefox to display it output is a bk which is incorrect for me Then i change the test jsp content to lt script language javascript gt alert a b replace g k lt script gt Note here i add two slashes instead of one In this case it works in the remote server but not in local one Then i rename the file from test jsp to test html but the content is the same as my first case i e lt script language javascript gt alert a b replace g k lt script gt By using the same firefox it works okay in both servers But my file needs to embed the javascript in jsp file it is not allowed to use html suffix for my file What should I do to write a portable javascript in this scenario My local server uses tomcat 5 5 26 remote server uses tomcat 5 0 28 Firefox version is 3 0 4,javascript
My compiler behaves oddly when I try to pass a fixed size array to a template function The code looks as follows include lt algorithm gt include lt iostream gt include lt iterator gt template lt typename TSize TSize N gt void f TSize amp array N std copy array array N std ostream_iterator lt TSize gt std cout std cout lt lt std endl int main int x 1 2 3 4 5 unsigned int y 1 2 3 4 5 f x f y line 15 see the error message It produces the following compile error in GCC 4 1 2 test cpp 15 error size of array has non integral type       TSize      test cpp 15 error invalid initialization of reference of type       unsigned int amp 1       from expression of type       unsigned int 5       test cpp 6 error in passing argument 1 of       void f TSize amp N with TSize unsigned int TSize N TSize 5       Note that the first call compiles and succeeds This seems to imply that while int is integral unsigned int isn t However if I change the declaration of my above function template to template lt typename TSize unsigned int N gt void f TSize amp array N the problem just goes away Notice that the only change here is from TSize N to unsigned int N Section dcl type simple in the final draft ISO IEC FDIS 14882 1998 seems to imply that an integral type is either signed or unsigned The signed specifier forces char objects and bit fields to be signed it is redundant with other integral types Regarding fixed size array declarations the draft says dcl array If the constant expression expr const is present it shall be an integral constant expression and its value shall be greater than zero So why does my code work with an explicit unsigned size type with an inferred signed size type but not with an inferred unsigned size type EDIT Serge wants to know where I d need the first version First this code example is obviously simplified My real code is a bit more elaborate The array is actually an array of indices offsets in another array So logically the type of the array should be the same as its size type for maximum correctness Otherwise I might get a type mismatch e g between unsigned int and std size_t Admittedly this shouldn t be a problem in practice since the compiler implicitly converts to the larger of the two types EDIT 2 I stand corrected thanks litb size and offset are of course logically different types and offsets into C arrays in particular are of type std ptrdiff_t,cpp
I have two webservices that have exactly the same methods and signatures but point at different servers specifically the Virtual Earth production and staging environments I wish to switch between using the production and staging services on the basis of a config setting and don t want to repeat myself and replicate each method where I call one of the services So what I need in effect is to create an interface which both of the services can implement and program against that But I don t know if this is advisable or even possible Or do I just need to reference one of the services and switch the url property depending on whether I want to use the production or staging environment,csharp

As a mostly self taught programmer I have never really had anyone explain why certain things should or should not be used One example which I picked up years ago and use quite often is the alternative control structure syntax x y true foo bar I personally find this syntax easy to follow especially for short concise code but I don t see it get a lot of use in the wild so I d like to know if it s bad practice to use this over a more traditional if else structure Thanks in advance,csharp

The naive way of writing building a menu in a Java Swing app is to do something like JMenu fileMenu new JMenu File JMenuItem openItem new JMenuItem Open openItem addActionListener new ActionListener action listener stuff fileMenu addMenuItem openItem A more experienced developer will recognize that actions can be accessed through a variety of mechanisms menus toolbar buttons maybe even other workflows in the system That person is more likely to write Action openAction new AbstractAction openAction setName Open openAction addActionListener new ActionListener action listener stuff JMenuItem openItem new JMenuItem openAction My question is what is the best way to manage these Action objects so they can be used across menus toolbars etc Create a factory class that returns specific actions Declare all of the actions as private static final Action in some utility class Take advantage of a Java application framework Something else,java
Searching on Google reveals x2 code snippets The first result is to this code recipe which has a lot of documentation and explanation along with some useful discussion underneath However another code sample whilst not containing so much documentation includes sample code for passing commands such as start stop and restart It also creates a PID file which can be handy for checking if the daemon is already running etc These samples both explain how to create the daemon Are there any additional things that need to be considered Is one sample better than the other and why,python

I m rolling my own logger class and want to represent the heirarchy of logs as the app moves through different phases log start loading loaded 400 values processing couldn t process var x etc In C yes I know I d use RAII classlets that pushed themselves on the log stack when created and popped off when they left the scope You could then leave functions at any point and still have consistent logging Obviously in C any variable has to be new d so it wouldn t be deleted until the next garbage collection cycle and if you immediately create a new classlet you could have an out of sync logger How would people try to solve this problem in C I want the logger syntax to be as unobtrusive to the current function as possible and still support functions with multiple exit points The only solution I can think of off the top of my head involves closeHeirarchy calls every return statement and you know I m going to miss one somewhere Edit I should make it clear I m interested mainly in how you would replicate the RAII behaviour in c Is there a mechanism that provides identical behaviour,csharp
I m looking for something similar to the Proxy pattern or the Dynamic Proxy Classes only that I don t want to intercept method calls before they are invoked on the real object but rather I d like to intercept properties that are being changed I d like the proxy to be able to represent multiple objects with different sets of properties Something like the Proxy class in Action Script 3 would be fine Here s what I want to achieve in general I have a thread running with an object that manages a list of values numbers strings objects which were handed over by other threads in the program so the class can take care of creating regular persistent snapshots on disk for the purpose of checkpointing the application This persistor object manages a dirty flag that signifies whether the list of values has changed since the last checkpoint and needs to lock the list while it s busy writing it to disk The persistor and the other components identify a particular item via a common name so that when recovering from a crash the other components can first check if the persistor has their latest copy saved and continue working where they left off During normal operation in order to work with the objects they handed over to the persistor I want them to receive a reference to a proxy object that looks as if it were the original one but whenever they change some value on it the persistor notices and acts accordingly for example by marking the item or the list as dirty before actually setting the real value Edit Alternatively are there generic setters like in PHP 5 in Java that is a method that gets called if a property doesn t exist Or is there a type of object that I can add properties to at runtime,java
I m working on a project and I m just starting to do all the work necessary to globalize the application One thing that comes up quite often is whether to globalize the exception messages but ensuring that string Format uses CultureInfo CurrentCulture instead of CultureInfo InvariantCulture Additionally this would mean that exception messages would be stored in resource files that can be marked as culture specific So the question is should exception messages be globalized or should be be left in either the InvariantCulture or the author s country in my case en US,csharp

Of course both F and C compile to IL and the CLR JITter does most of the hard work however I wanted to know whether there s anything implicit in the F language or its core libraries which result in lesser performance compared to C Additionally is there anything in the use of functional programming in the net framework that might make it slower compared to C I am going to sit down and measure differences of course as that really is the only real way to know for sure however I just wondered whether anybody had any broad stroke knowledge on this topic See Also C F Performance comparison Is a program F any more efficient execution wise than C,csharp

Let s say I have an existing application written in Java which I wish to add scripting support to This is fairly trivial with Groovy and just as trivial in Net with any of the Iron range of dynamic languages As trivial as adding the support is it raises a whole host of questions about script execution and security and how to implement that security Has anyone come across any interesting articles papers or have any insights into this that they d like to share In particular I d be very interested in architectural things like execution contexts script authentication script signing and things along those lines you know the kind of stuff that prevents users from running arbitrary scripts they just happened to download which managed to screw up their entire application whilst still allowing scripts to be useful and flexible Quick Edit I ve mentioned signing and authentication as different entities because I see them as different aspects of security For example as the developer supplier of the application I distribute a signed script This script is legitimately data destructive by design Such as it s nature it should only be run by administrators and therefore the vast majority of users system processes should not be able to run it This being the case it seems to me that some sort of security authentication context is required based on the actions the script performs and who is running that script,java
Howdy all I d like to know if it s possible to determine what inline styling has been attributed to an HTML element I do not need to retrieve the value but rather just detect if it s been set inline or not For instance if the HTML were lt div id foo style width 100px height 100px background green gt lt div gt How can I determine that width height and background have been explicitly declared inline As far as I can tell the solution can work two ways I can ask it if a specific attribute is set and it will tell me true or false or it can tell me all attributes that have been set Like so var obj document getElementById foo obj hasInlineStyle width returns true obj hasInlineStyle border returns false or obj getInlineStyles returns array with values width height and background I m not interested in css attributes that are inherited via declarations in a stylesheet only inline styles One last thing I have no control over the HTML source Thanks,javascript

I have a question about the primitive type short in Java I am using JDK 1 6 If I have the following short a 2 short b 3 short c a b the compiler does not want to compile it says that it cannot convert from int to short and suggests that I make a cast to short so this short c short a b really works But my question is why do I need to cast The values of a and b are in the range of short the range of short values is 32 768 32767 I also need to cast when I want to perform the operations I haven t checked for others If I do the same for primitive type int I do not need to cast aa bb to int The following works fine int aa 2 int bb 3 int cc aa bb I discovered this while designing a class where I needed to add two variables of type short and the compiler wanted me to make a cast If I do this with two variables of type int I don t need to cast Thank you very much in advance A small remark the same thing also happens with the primitive type byte So this works byte a 2 byte b 3 byte c byte a b but this not byte a 2 byte b 3 byte c a b For long float double and int there is no need to cast Only for short and byte values,java

I m working on implementing sprited buttons in Stackoverflow s beloved WMD markdown editor and I ve run into an odd bug On all versions of IE the selected text is lost upon button clicks so say highlighting a block of text and clicking the code button acts like you placed the cursor at the end of the selection and clicked the button e g highlighting this This Is Code and clicking the code button give you This Is Code enter code here What s really weird is that I left the original non sprited button bar in and that works just fine In fact ALL buttons and keyboard shortcuts code use the same doClick button function Old style non sprited buttons OK Keyboard shortcuts OK Sprited buttons in non IE browsers OK Sprited buttons in IE WTF I ve isolated the problem down to a call to selection createRange which finds nothing only when the sprited button is clicked I ve tried screwing around with focus ing and making sure as little as possible happens before the doClick but no joy The keyboard shortcuts seem to work because the focus is never lost from the input textarea Can anyone think of a hack that will let me somehow collect the selected text in IE The onclick handler looks like this button onmouseout function this style backgroundPosition this XShift normalYShift button onclick function if this onmouseout this onmouseout doClick this I ve tried moving the onmouseout call to after the doClick in case that was causing a loss of focus but that s not the problem EDIT The only thing that seems to be different is that in the original button code you are clicking on an image In the sprited code you are clicking on a list item lt li gt with a background image set Perhaps it s trying to select the non existent text in my list item EDIT Actual code is located in my wmd repository on git in the button cleanup branch If you revert to the 0d6d1b32bb42a6bd1d4ac4e409a19fdfe8f1ffcc commit you can see both button bars The top one is sprited and exhibits the weird behavior The bottom one contains the remnants of the original button bar and works fine The suspect code is in the setInputAreaSelectionStartEnd function in the TextareaState object One last thing I should mention is that for the time being I m trying to keep the control in pure Javascript so I d like to avoid fixing this with an external library like jQuery if that s possible Thanks for your help,javascript
I have one console app that is doing some lengthy syncing to an ftp server Another console app prepares a local filesystem with some needed updated files Then the second one will wait for the first one to finish before swapping a final directory name so it becomes visible on the web I searched for the best way to make the syncing app to communicate to the second app that it s finished it s job It looks like Using Data Copy for IPC is the best suited solution for this Question is two fold Am I right Is there a more straight forward way to get to the same result Is there a managed net way to do this,csharp

Given an instance of some class in Python it would be useful to be able to determine which line of source code defined each method and property e g to implement 1 For example given a module ab py class A object z 1 q 2 def y self pass def x self pass class B A q 4 def x self pass def w self pass define a function whither class_ attribute returning a tuple containing the filename class and line in the source code that defined or subclassed attribute This means the definition in the class body not the latest assignment due to overeager dynamism It s fine if it returns unknown for some attributes gt gt gt a A gt gt gt b B gt gt gt b spigot brass gt gt gt whither a z ab py lt class a A gt line 2 gt gt gt whither b q ab py lt class a B gt 8 gt gt gt whither b x ab py lt class a B gt 9 gt gt gt whither b spigot Attribute spigot is a data attribute I want to use this while introspecting Plone where every object has hundreds of methods and it would be really useful to sort through them organized by class and not just alphabetically Of course in Python you can t always reasonably know but it would be nice to get good answers in the common case of mostly static code,python

My workshop has recently switched to Subversion from SourceSafe freeing us from automatic locks This led to concurrent editing of the Forms which is wonderful But when multiple developers commit their changes the code files created by the designer all the files named TheFormName designer cs cause conflicts which are very difficult to resolve As far as I can tell this is because the code generated by the designer is heavily re arranged whenever the user modifies it no matter how little the actual change really did How do I make these conflicts easier to resolve Is there some way to tell the designer to modify the code less How do you the experienced C teams deal with concurrent modification of a Form,csharp
The desired functionality of the enhanced combo box is a quick find method Each item in the combobox has a ToString method such that they can be displayed in the drop down list On clicking an item in the drop down list the combobox s observers are notified of the selection Also every time the typed text in the combobox changes a list of Candidates is generated made of all those items in the drop down list which contain the text typed in so far Hitting enter takes you to the first candidate in that list repeatedly hitting enter cycles you through the list I ve implemented this functionality by deriving from ComboBox I figured this made sense as I m still functionally left with a combobox it just has this QuickFind feature added However the logic to create the candidate list and cycle through it whilst simple isn t totally trivial and would enjoy some testing However as seen here it doesn t seem to be all that easy to test a ComboBox just by constructing it and prodding the extra routines I ve added it needs to exist on a form for it to behave the same way as it does in the application This seems altogether too much effort to test a simple addition to a simple combo box Nothing in the code to cycle through the candidates is specific to my application however I have created a general control that may be used in any number of contexts the only requirement being that the objects in the combobox have a ToString methiod which is the same restriction placed on objects going into normal comboboxes anyway and is guaranteed by C NET So with testability in mind where would you put the enhanced functionality,csharp

Does anyone know if HQL has a keyword to identify rows such as ROWID or ROWNUM I would like to implement pagination with HQL but I am not able to use setMaxResult or setFirstResult because I don t work with the session object directly and therefore don t use the Query object but simply create my query as a string and use the find method I tried using LIMIT and OFFSET in my query but HQL seems to be ignoring these keywords and is returning the whole result to me no matter what I m also not able to use Hibernate criteria because it does not have support for the HAVING clause that appears in my query My last resort is to restrict the result set using the ROWNUM ROWID keyword Does anyone else have any other suggestions,java
I am starting a project with asp net visual studio 2008 SQL 2000 2005 in future using c The tricky part for me is that the existing DB schema changes often and the import files columns will all have to be matched up with the existing db schema since they may not be one to one match on column names There is a lookup table that provides the tables schema with column names I will use I am exploring different ways to approach this and need some expert advice Is there any existing controls or frameworks that I can leverage to do any of this So far I explored FileUpload NET control as well as some 3rd party upload controls to accomplish the upload such as SlickUpload but the files uploaded should be lt 500mb Next part is reading of my csv excel and parsing it for display to the user so they can match it with our db schema I saw CSVReader and others but for excel its more difficult since I will need to support different versions Essentially The user performing this import will insert and or update several tables from this import file There are other more advance requirements like record matching but and preview of the import records but I wish to get through understanding how to do this first Update I ended up using csvReader with LumenWorks Framework for uploading the csv files,csharp
While I like to think of myself as a reasonably competent Python coder one aspect of the language I ve never been able to grok is decorators I know what they are superficially I ve read tutorials examples questions on Stack Overflow and I understand the syntax can write my own occasionally use classmethod and staticmethod but it never occurs to me to use a decorator to solve a problem in my own Python code I never encounter a problem where I think Hmm this looks like a job for a decorator So I m wondering if you guys might offer some examples of where you ve used decorators in your own programs and hopefully I ll have an A ha moment and get them,python

I have recently integrated the NET NLog logging component into one of our applications which developed purely in unmanaged code C and VB6 components compiled in Visual Studio 6 We have a bunch of C application talking to NLog via a COM interface Everything is working fine at the moment but I do notice that the following message pops up in the output window if debugging the C component in VS6 as a prompt in the IDE if debugging NLog via VS 2005 during program termination LoaderLock was detected Message Attempting managed execution inside OS Loader lock Do not attempt to run managed code inside a DllMain or image initialization function since doing so can cause the application to hang The DllMain is as follows extern C BOOL WINAPI DllMain HINSTANCE hInstance DWORD dwReason LPVOID lpReserved if dwReason DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH _Module Init ObjectMap hInstance DisableThreadLibraryCalls hInstance else if dwReason DLL_PROCESS_DETACH _Module Term return TRUE ok My guess is that _Module Term now includes the releasing of some NET references I am keeping a reference to a NLog object in one of my C classes to avoid having to instantiate and release each time which is causing this warning to pop up My question is this safe to ignore If it isn t what is a good workaround the best I can think of is to instantiate a reference to that NLog object and release it every time I want to write to the log file not the most elegant of solutions,cpp

I m sending some data over AJAX to a PHP file It s about filter options Anyway I am sending it like this filter 0 data type string filter 0 data value automobiles filter 0 field product filter 1 data type numeric filter 1 data value 6000 filter 1 field price This above is taken from FireBug console Then in PHP filter _POST filter i if is_array filter for i 0 i lt count filter i switch filter i data type case string I m doing my select from database based on that and so on So the translation of this would be Get me all the records from database that are hmm let s check the filters I m getting the first filter type witch is string witch needs to be applied to the mysql column named product So I m searching for the value of automobiles there But I m not finished yet the second filter refers to a numeric filter for the column price from database so I m taking its value and add it to the query So I ll end up selecting all the automobiles that have a price greater than 6000 So far so good The problem is that my way of getting data have changed and I can t send my data in this format no more The new format is an URL witch looks like this filter 0 field prodct amp filter 0 data type string amp filter 0 data value automobiles amp filter 1 field price amp filter 1 data type numeric amp filter 1 data value 6000 I can do an explode on this one by the amp and end up with an array I can do a lot The problem is that I don t know how to adjust my query building script to work with that kind of received data So that I can do a switch filter i data type again Any ideas for modifying the code Thank you,php

I have a PHP script which reads a large CSV and performs certain actions but only if the username field is unique The CSV is used in more than one script so changing the input from the CSV to only contain unique usernames is not an option The very basic program flow which I m wondering about goes like this allUsernames array while row fgetcsv fp username row 0 if in_array username allUsernames continue allUsernames username process this row Since this CSV could actually be quite large it s that in_array bit which has got me thinking The most ideal situation when searching through an array for a member is if it is already sorted so how would you build up an array from scratch keeping it in order Once it is in order would there be a more efficient way to search it than using in_array considering that it probably doesn t know the array is sorted,php
I have an Ajax request to a web service that typically takes 30 60 seconds to complete In some cases it could take as long as a few minutes During this time the user can continue working on other tasks which means they will probably be on a different page when the task finishes Is there a way to tell that the original request has been completed The only thing that comes to mind is to wrap the web service with a web service of my own use my web service to set a flag somewhere check for that flag in subsequent page requests Any better ways to do it I am using jQuery and ASP Net if it matters,jquery

It sometimes want to block my thread while waiting for a event to occur I usually do it something like this private AutoResetEvent _autoResetEvent new AutoResetEvent false private void OnEvent object sender EventArgs e _autoResetEvent Set button Click OnEvent try _autoResetEvent WaitOne finally button Click OnEvent However it seems that this should be something that I could extract to a common class or perhaps even something that already exists in the framework I would like to be able to do something like this EventWaiter ew new EventWaiter button Click ew WaitOne EventWaiter ew2 new EventWaiter form Closing ew2 WaitOne But I can t really find a way to construct such a class I can t find a good valid way to pass the event as an argument Can anyone help To give an example of why this can be useful consider something like this var status ShowStatusForm status ShowInsertUsbStick bool cancelled WaitForUsbStickOrCancel if cancelled status ShowWritingOnUsbStick WriteOnUsbStick status AskUserToRemoveUsbStick WaitForUsbStickToBeRemoved status ShowFinished else status ShowCancelled status WaitUntilUserPressesDone This is much more concise and readable than the equivalent code written with the logic spread out between many methods But to implement WaitForUsbStickOrCancel WaitForUsbStickToBeRemoved and WaitUntilUserPressesDone assume that the we get an event when usb sticks are inserted or removed I need to reimplement EventWaiter each time Of course you have to be careful to never run this on the GUI thread but sometimes that is a worthwhile tradeoff for the simpler code The alternative would look something like this var status ShowStatusForm status ShowInsertUsbStick usbHandler Inserted OnInserted status Cancel OnCancel void OnInserted usbHandler Inserted OnInserted status ShowWritingOnUsbStick MethodInvoker mi gt WriteOnUsbStick mi BeginInvoke WritingDone null void WritingDone EndInvoke status AskUserToRemoveUsbStick usbHandler Removed OnRemoved void OnRemoved usbHandler Removed OnRemoved status ShowFinished status Done OnDone etc I find that much harder to read Admittedly it is far from always that the flow will be so linear but when it is I like the first style It is comparable to using ShowMessage and Form ShowDialog they also block until some event occurs though they will run a message loop if they are called on the gui thread,csharp

Under what circumstances would you use MicrosoftAjax over jQuery in an ASP NET MVC application According to Scott Cate in this podcast Object Oriented AJAX with Scott Cate MicrosoftAjax is good for sending and retrieving data to and from the server And jQuery is good for manipulating your data via the DOM once it arrives at the client Yet with a simple form plugin for jQuery you can send and retrieve data with jQuery quite easily Often with a single line of code So I m wondering what the difference is between MicrosoftAjax and jQuery within ASP NET MVC,jquery

I am trying to parse some RTF that i get back from the server For most text i get back this works fine and using a RichTextBox control will do the job however some of the RTF seems to contain an additional encoding and some of the characters get corrupted The original string is as follows and contains some of the characters used in Polish                                   The RTF string with hex encoded characters that is send back looks like this lang1045 langfe1045 f16383 b9 e6 ea b3 f7 a8 bd a8 ae 9c 9f bf I am having problems decoding the         characters in the returned string they seem to be represented by two hex values each whereas the rest of the string is represented as expected by single hex values Using a RichTextBox control to parse the RTF results in corrupter text the two characters in question are displayed as four different unwanted characters If i would encode the plain string myself to hex using the expected codepage 1250 Latin 2 the ANSI codepage for lcid 1045 i would get the following B9 E6 EA B3 F1 F3 9C 9F BF I am lost as to how i can correctly decode the f7 a8 bd a8 ae part of the returned string that should correspond to         Note that there is no font definition for f7 in the RTF header and the string looks fine when viewed directly on the server meaning that the characters if they are corrupted are corrupted somewhere in the conversion before sending I am not sure if the problem is on the server side as i have no control over that but since the server is used for a lot of translation work i assume that the returned string is ok I have been going through the RTF specs but can not find any hint regarding this type of combination of encodings,csharp

I m writing an integration test where I will be inserting a number of objects into a database and then checking to make sure whether my method retrieves those objects My connection to the database is through NHibernate and my usual method of creating such a test would be to do the following NHibernateSession BeginTransaction use nhibernate to insert objects into database retrieve objects via my method verify actual objects returned are the same as those inserted NHibernateSession RollbackTransaction However I ve recently found out about TransactionScope which apparently can be used for this very purpose Some example code I ve found is as follows public static int AddDepartmentWithEmployees Department dept int res 0 DepartmentAdapter deptAdapter new DepartmentAdapter EmployeeAdapter empAdapter new EmployeeAdapter using TransactionScope txScope new TransactionScope res deptAdapter Insert dept DepartmentName Custom method made to return Department ID after inserting the department Identity Column dept DepartmentID deptAdapter GetInsertReturnValue foreach Employee emp in dept Employees emp EmployeeDeptID dept DepartmentID res empAdapter Insert emp EmployeeName emp EmployeeDeptID txScope Complete return res I believe that if I don t include the line txScope Complete that the data inserted will be rolled back But unfortunately I don t understand how that is possible how does the txScope object keep a track of the deptAdapter and empAdapter objects and their transactions on the database I feel like I m missing a bit of information here am I really able to replace my BeginTransaction and RollbackTransaction calls by surrounding my code using TransactionScope If not how then does TransactionScope work to roll back transactions,csharp
I m having a bit of trouble doing some unit testing using moq If I have a function like this public string GetName IMapinfoWrapper wrapper return wrapper Evaluate My com command My comm command is the same all the time Then I have a test that checks the return value of the GetName function Test public void Test Mock lt IMapinfoWrapper gt mock new Mock lt IMapinfoWrapper gt mock Expect mapinfo gt mapinfo Evaluate It IsAny lt String gt Returns TableName Assert AreEqual TableName GetName mock object So my question is should the mock be define like this mock Expect mapinfo gt mapinfo Evaluate It IsAny lt String gt Returns TableName or like this mock Expect mapinfo gt mapinfo Evaluate My com command Returns TableName My only problem with using the second way is that I feel like I m tying the implementation of the method GetName to always use the My com command string internally Is this what I should be doing or am I doing this all wrong I have only started doing unit testing and mocking so I m still not sure how everything should go together,csharp
I ve been using this pattern when I need to control how long various async operations take I don t mean specifically for WebRequest I know you can set the timeout property I just used this as an example for the pattern var request WebRequest Create someUri WebResponse response null request BeginGetResponse result gt var asyncRequest WebRequest result AsyncState response asyncRequest EndGetResponse result request DateTime timeout DateTime Now AddSeconds 10 while response null amp amp DateTime Now lt timeout Thread Sleep 0 if response null throw new Exception Timeout Anywhere I read about Thread Sleep I heard it s a baaaad thing to do but I don t really think this use case abuses it I know it is possible that it could be a little bit more than exactly 10 seconds but that isn t important to me So is this truly a bad way to accomplish what I m accomplishing and if so what is a better way to do it EDIT Perhaps I should clarify what I m trying to accomplish The purpose is to control the maximum amount of time spent waiting on a call I m aware that this defeats the purpose of an async call but the intention was never to be asynchronous I m just using it as a means to control when I exit a call,csharp
Does anyone know of a good open source security framework for java I ve played with jSecurity a bit and it seems really cool but the documentation is so sparce I can t seem to make any progress Spring security seems web app oriented but I may be wrong I am not opposed to writing this myself but it seems like this should have been done before why reinvent the wheel All this needs to do is be able to provide fine grained security permissions on each level of the app s Example App1 has actions 1 2 3 like canOpenRemoteFiles or canReprocessTransactions App2 has actions 4 5 6 7 I will ultimately need to do something like the call may not be this declarative boolean foo user getApp1 canReprocessTransactions do something with foo or something like this boolean bar user getApp2 canDoAction1 do something with bar or ArrayList lt String gt dirsCanAccess user getApp1 getAccessableDirs Thanks in advance,java
I have a C app and I need to convert between 3 different units say for example litres gallons and pints The app needs to know about certain volumes of liquid say 1 pint 10 pints 20 pints and 100 pints I intend to do the calculations and hard code the values not ideal but necessary I m looking for a data structure that will allow me to easily convert from one unit to another Any suggestions Please note I m not actually using volumes of liquid its just an example,csharp

What we ideally need is to know how Microsoft handles XAML generated code Those g cs files If you goto a XAML code behind intellisense will work even if the g cs file is not part of the project Context In a custom VS package we need to have some logic to open a CS file with out making it a part of the project in the VS IDE to allow the user to edit it We are hooking up the document to the Running document table and receiving the events like Saving Close and all using IVSRunningDocumentTable Works good Now the problem is when the document is opened Intellisense can t work for the simple reason that the opened document is not part of the project sadly we can t do that we can t make it code behind,csharp
I have made a class which a form can inherit from and it handles form Location Size and State And it works nicely Except for one thing When you maximize the application on a different screen than your main one the location and size before you maximized gets stored correctly but when it is maximized according to its previous state it is maximized on my main monitor When I then restore it to normal state it goes to the other screen where it was before When I then maximize it again it of course maximized on the correct screen So my question is how can I make a form when it is maximized remember what screen it was maximized on And how do I restore that when the form opens again Kind of complete solution to problem I accepted the answer which had a very good tip about how to if on screen But that was just part of my problem so here is my solution On load First get stored Bounds and WindowState from whatever storage Then set the Bounds Make sure Bounds are visible either by Screen AllScreens Any     gt     Bounds IntersectsWith Bounds or MdiParent Controls OfType lt MdiClient gt First ClientRectangle IntersectsWith Bounds If it doesn t just do Location new Point Then set window state On closing Store WindowState If WindowState is FormWindowState Normal then store Bounds otherwise store RestoreBounds And thats it Some example code So as suggested by Oliver here is some code It needs to be fleshed out sort of but this can be used as a start for whoever wants to PersistentFormHandler Takes care of storing and fetching the data somewhere public sealed class

cast and return var b new BinaryFormatter return T b Deserialize s catch InvalidCastException T is not what it should have been Code changed perhaps catch SerializationException Something went wrong during Deserialization Else return fallback return fallback Note 1 In the load method you have to look for previously stored WindowState WindowBounds and other values We use SQL Server and have a Window table with columns for Id Name MachineName for Environment MachineName UserId WindowState X Y Height Width So for every window you would have one row with WindowState X Y Height and Width for each user and machine In addition we have a WindowValues table which just has a foreign key to WindowId a Key column of type String and a Value column of type Binary If there is stuff that is not found I just leave things default and return false Note 2 In the save method you then of course do the reverse from what you do in the Load method Creating rows for Window and WindowValues if they don t exist already for the current user and machine PersistentFormBase This class uses the previous class and forms a handy base class for other forms Should have been abstract but that makes the the

If anything else should be stored like a splitter distance you would listen for the ValuesLoaded and StoringValues events and in those use the GetValue and StoreValue methods Hope this can help someone Please let me know if it does And also please provide some feedback if there is anything you think could be done better or something I would like to learn,csharp

so tired that I missed it every time I call that function it re initializes those same variables again I will put variables into another variable and then it will get re initialized to default values I tried using a counter variable that counted to one after it initialized and then after it was 1 it wouldnt initialize again No that didn t work because the variables werent initialized outside the scope of the if statement I then tried a GOTO statement that would skip the initialization after it happened once Nope something went wrong with the first initialization phase and no compilation I need to figure out how I can either keep those variables from getting re assigned or initialized so they can maintain their values Or figure out how to create global class objects and yes I ve tried the extern classes with multiple source files No luck just lots of errors I m not very good at programming yet But I assure you I ve been working on this piece for hours and hours and hours and I stayed up all night just constantly trial and error I really proud of myself because this code is pretty advanced for me I ve looked at every tutorial on Google and I m fresh out of luck you guys are my last hope Sorry again guys I know this is a dumb question One last quick question How do you create Global Class Objects For example MyClass MyClass MyClass MyClass MyClassObject How do I use MyClassObject throughout my entire program The only way I can use it is if I create a new object every time with every function I use And that means I lose all data stored inside my class I ve read that having global object isn t a good idea though I would love to not have to use them but I have no clue on any alternatives that I can actually understand Any other critiques or tips is GREATLY appreciated I love this stuff I just don t have many people to ask questions to,cpp

I have used AOP within spring with no real problems mainly for transaction management for which it works a charm My question is this the only examples I ve seen for AOP so far is to pointcut a class that you have created yourself Is it possible to pointcut a class within a third party library for example a database connection class The context is that I wish to create some logs and gather information when an oracle data source executes a call to the database which is unfortunately contained within a stack of oracle class files How would you pointcut this class method when the SQL is executed,java

I m building a PHP application using the data mapper pattern to separate my DB from the domain objects I have a mapper class that returns Site objects based on data from the DB and accepts existing Site objects to be saved back to the DB My problem is that in the system one and only one of all the sites has to be marked as the primary site which means that if I set one as the primary I d like to be able to automatically unset the current primary So something like mapper new Site_Mapper site mapper gt fetch 2 site gt isPrimary true mapper gt save site Would somehow in the background automatically do this mapper new Site_Mapper site mapper gt fetch 1 site gt isPrimary false mapper gt save site Question is where should the logic for automatically updating the existing primary site go It has to happen after the object is saved back to the DB not before in case the DB query fails and you re left with no site as the primary Cheers Jack,php

I have a base class with a virtual function and I want to override that function in a derived class Is there some way to make the compiler check if the function I declared in the derived class actually overrides a function in the base class I would like to add some macro or something that ensures that I didn t accidentally declare a new function instead of overriding the old one Take this example class parent public virtual void handle_event int something const boring default code class child public parent public virtual void handle_event int something new exciting code int main parent p new child p gt handle_event 1 Here parent handle_event is called instead of child handle_event because the child s method misses the const declaration and therefore declares a new method This could also be a typo in the function name or some minor difference in the parameters types It can also easily happen if the interface of the base class changes and somewhere some derived class wasn t updated to reflect the change Is there some way to avoid this problem can I somehow tell the compiler or some other tool to check this for me Any helpful compiler flags preferably for g How do you avoid these problems,cpp

We re using both Apache Tomcat 6 0 and Jetty 6 where I work We mostly use Jetty for testing it s great for running embedded in JUnit tests and Tomcat for production By default Tomcat compiles JSPs on the fly as users request them But this results in degraded performance for the first hit It also highlights bizarre bugs in Tomcat s JSP compiler The Tomcat documentation gives recommendations for pre compiling JSPs at build time using Ant and a Maven plugin is also available but the resulting WAR contains Tomcat specific stuff e g PageContextImpl proprietaryEvaluate so we can t use it in Jetty Is there some flag or setting we can use somewhere to force Tomcat to precompile all JSPs as soon as the WAR is initialized We re prepared to wait a little longer on startup for this In advance I know there s a way to pre compile exactly one JSP by explicitly identifying a servlet load on startup tag in web xml for one JSP But for dozens or even hundreds of JSPs that becomes unmanageable,java

I ve got this nasty problem where sending multiple large messages in quick succession from a Java NIO server running Linux to a client will lead to truncated packets The messages have to be large and sent very rapidly for the problem to occur Here s basically what my code is doing not actual code but more or less what s happening setup stuff Charset charset Charset forName UTF 8 CharsetEncoder encoder charset newEncoder String msg A very long message let s say 20KB inside loop to handle incoming connections ServerSocketChannel ssc ServerSocketChannel key channel SocketChannel sc ssc accept sc configureBlocking false sc socket setTcpNoDelay true sc socket setSendBufferSize 1024 1024 later actual sending of messages for int n 0 n lt 20 n ByteBuffer bb encoder encode CharBuffer wrap msg 0 sc write bb bb rewind So if the packets are long enough and sent as quickly as possible i e in a loop like this with no delay then on the other end it often comes out something like this COMPLETE PACKET 1 COMPLETE PACKET 2 COMPLETE PACKET 3 START OF PACKET 4 SOME OR ALL OF PACKET 5 There is data loss and the packets start to run together such that the start of packet 5 in this example arrives in the same message as the start of packet 4 It s not just truncating its running the messages together I imagine that this is related to the TCP buffer or window size or that the server here is just providing data faster than the OS or network adapter or something can handle it But how do I check for and prevent it from happening If I reduce the length of message per use of sc write but then increase the repetitions I ll still run into the same problem It seems to simply be an issue with the amount of data in a short amount of time I don t see that sc write is throwing any exceptions either I know that in my example above I m not checking but have in my tests I d be happy if I could programmatically check if it is not ready for more data yet and put in a delay and wait until it is ready I m also not sure if sc socket setSendBufferSize 1024 1024 has any effect or if I d need to adjust this on the Linux side of things Is there a way to really flush out a SocketChannel As a lame workaround I could try to explicitly force a complete send of anything that is buffered any time I m trying to send a message of over 10KB for example which is not that often in my application But I don t know of any way to force a send of the buffer or wait until it has sent Thanks for any help,java

What would be the most idiomatic way to do the following in javascript If myParam is not passed into MyFunc by the caller then I want to set it to a default value But first I want to try and get it from another object which may not yet exist function MyFunc myParam if myParam if myObj myParam 10 else myParam myObj myParam alert myParam I started to write myParam myParam myObj mParam 10 but realized that if myObj does not exist then this would fail I might guess the following myParam myParam myObj amp amp myObj mParam 10 It might even work But is it the best way How would for example John Resig do it,javascript
I am curious why C allows me to ignore delegate parameters in some cases but not others For instance this is permitted Action lt int gt action delegate Console WriteLine delegate but this is not Action lt int gt action gt Console WriteLine lambda Is there a way to initialize a delegate and ignore the parameters using a lambda I know that I can add a single parameter to the lambda and fix the previous line but this is more of an academic question pertaining to the compiler and why or how this works,csharp

I need to save a history of states over a few actions in a Java application which I can later reload in order to restore the state at a certain action In other words I have a screen which has a state associated with it and I need to store it as well as any changes in a history so that I can restore the state of the screen at any time This is kind of like undo but not exactly as the difference between two state can be very large and there are no well defined actions that changes the states Let me explain with an example A very basic screen state might just contain a single Map In state A this Map contains a reference to Object1 with key Key1 and Object2 with key Key2 In state B the Map still contains the reference to Object1 but Object2 has been modified and an Object3 has been added I now need to be able to return to state A which would involve dropping Object3 and restoring Object2 to its previous state I cannot define any custom undo actions as I do not know what changes were made to Object2 or even what the type of Object2 is Further because the reference remains the same for Object2 in state A and B those changes are reflected in state A so Object2 isn t the same as it was I realize the best solution is to implement clone methods but as I need to support all types of Objects including primitives and standard collections this isn t feasible I thought about using serializable where I would serialize the Map as soon as a state transition happens and then deserialize it when it is needed again but it seems like a very ugly solution Does anybody have any other ideas Thank you Ristretto,java

When you have a class car that implements IVehicle and you want to wrap it in a decorator that forwards all calls to car and counts them how would you do it In Ruby I could just build a decorator without any methods and use method_missing to forward all calls to the car object In Java I could build a Proxy object that runs all code through one method and forwards it afterwards Is there any similiar thing i can do in C update based on the answeres and what i    ve read about System Reflection Emit it should be possible to write a method similiar to this Type proxyBuilder Type someType delagate functionToBeApplied Object forward where type implements all interface of someType executes functionToBeApplied and then forwards the method call to object while returning its return Is there some lib that does just that or would i have to write my own,csharp

Hi Is there a way to reduce unnecessary empty fields in SQL inserts and SQL updates For example I have a single hibernate entity class mapped to a table that has 10 columns The populating of data is actually done in two phases When the user submit a request I will insert the request information into the table with the hibernate entity but populating only 7 fields After some processing wait for other users interaction for example I will populate the remaining 3 fields with the id given from the previous insert If I stick with a single entity class for the second update the steps I do is as follows 1 Load the entity identified by id 2 Save the entity which generates sql that seems to be sending all the fields over Alternatively I created two entity class and point to the same table and save them seperately Does anyone have a better suggestion Kent Edit What I really like to achieve is something to the following effect insert t id field1 field2 update t set field3 field4 where id The best I could achieve now with dynamicUpdate true is insert t id field1 field2 select field1 field2 field3 field4 from t where id update t set field3 field4 where id Is there a way to eliminate that select statement The original persisted object is not stored anywhere in memory after the insert An additional note The entity class is annotated with Hibernate validation I am currently trying out to achieve the above desired effect so I commented them out But when I turn them back on I get validation errors due to NotNull and NotEmpty,java

I am re designing part of our internal ORM tool and I want to expose Field a class that represents a field in the database like CustomerFirstName directly to the end developer So that was easy enough to accomplish however the API got a little ugly because this Field class was previously used internally and is too open For instance and this is just one small example the IsDirty property was not read only and that s something end developers shouldn t be able to tamper with I thought about maybe creating two interfaces IPublicField and IPrivateField and trying to get the field class to implement both of them However continuing with the IsDirty example I didn t want something like this Public ReadOnly Property PrivateIsDirty Implements IPrivateField IsDirty End Property Public Property IsDirty Implements IPublicField IsDirty End Property It s just a little ugly plus you could still cast back to the Field class and get into the non readonly method I also didn t want to introduce a seperate setter method because it would be another breaking change that I don t want to think about and it also would create an inconsistency with other parts of the API I ended up renaming the Field class to InnerField and creating a facade wrapper style structure around it like this Public Class Field Implements BusinessObjects IField Private InnerField As BusinessObjects IInnerField Public Sub New ByVal field As IInnerField InnerField field End Sub Public ReadOnly Property IsDirty As Boolean Implements BusinessObjects IField IsDirty Get Return InnerField IsDirty End Get End Property End Class This seems to be working out pretty well Internally the InnerField is suitably open and we have the freedom to make it more open in the future without impacting end developers and externally the Field class provides the simplified locked down tool that end developers need So assuming that was coherent I was wondering how you might have proceeded in this situation and whether my solution seems reasonable from the outside Thanks,csharp
So I need a 2 dimensional ConcurrentHashMap It has to be as blazing fast as possible as I m going to be adding to and updating its values extremely frequently It s in a multithreaded application hence the choice to use ConcurrentHashMap instead of just HashMap Both the x and y indices are integers with a known range 0 through 40 000 000 What I need to know is What s the most efficient way to implement this so it ll be as speedy as possible The most obvious route is to do a literal 2 D hashmap ConcurrentHashMap lt Integer ConcurrentHashMap lt Integer ValueObj gt gt foo Or I could make a private class IntPair with two properties x and y and use that as a key though if I do that what s the most efficient way to do equals and hashcode and will I wind up allocating too many new IntPairs Could I keep a set of IntPairs for each x y I ve assigned and then use a purely reflexive equals such that I m just checking for the exact same object instance Update Now that I ve taken a closer look at Integer valueOf int the specific caching model it uses wouldn t make sense here since I m dealing with a very sparse matrix with unpredictable entries I really need to be caching all those IntPairs which are used not a prespecified subset Intuitively it seems to me that looking up an IntPair in a big map to see if I ve already created it would in fact be more or less the same as just looking it up in the big 2 D ConcurrentHashMap anyway wouldn t it So it seems the solution here is really to just use new IntPair x y each time I look up a key Yes,java

Which is the best way to parse an XML file in PHP First Using the DOM object code dom new DOMDocument dom gt load xml xml root dom gt getElementsByTagName tag foreach root as tag subChild root gt getElementsByTagName child extract values and loop again if needed Second Using the simplexml_load Method code xml simplexml_load_string xml xml root xml gt root foreach root as tag subChild tag gt child extract values and loop again if needed Note These are the two I am aware of If there are more fill in Wanted to know which method is the best for parsing huge XML files also which method is the fastest irrespective of the way the method needs to be implemented Size will be varying from 500KB to 2MB The parser should be able to parse small as well as large files in the least amount of time with good memory usage if possible,php
Google maps is an impressive display of what you can do with javascript and Ajaxy goodness Even my mouse scroll wheel and right click works to provide specific functionality In the standard HTML spec I don t see an onmouserightclick event or similar basic javascript handling for the mouse wheel Maybe I am looking in the wrong places I presume these events are browser and platform specific or sensitive instead of specific And am wondering what the basic plain HTML and Javascript is needed to exploit these events in ALL browsers Naturally when designing a site these features have to be extra since some people still use the one button mouse How to I use events with the mouse wheel and right click I m looking for sample code EDIT Thanks for the jQuery code guys The system developer in me still has questions and doubts though Mainly I m concerned about platform limitations that would seem to apply here Is there a browser that some of these features don t work in Does the mouse wheel up and down events also allow for mouse wheel click events I would just expect there to be some limitation out there and am wondering if it s officially documented I want to know how it works at the low level I am glad to see it is easy in jQuery another reason for me to get into it,javascript
We have to build Strings all the time for log output and so on Over the JDK versions we have learned when to use StringBuffer many appends thread safe and StringBuilder many appends non thread safe What s the advice on using String format Is it efficient or are we forced to stick with concatenation for one liners where performance is important e g ugly old style String s What do you get if you multiply varSix by varNine vs tidy new style and possibly slow String s String format What do you get if you multiply d by d varSix varNine Note my specific use case is the hundreds of one liner log strings throughout my code They don t involve a loop so StringBuilder is too heavyweight I m interested in String format specifically,java

Suppose I have some application A with a database Now I want to add another application B which should keep track of the database changes of application A Application B should do some calculations when data has changed There is no direct communication between both applications Both can only see the database The basic problem is Some data changes in the database How can I trigger some C code doing some work upon these changes To give some stimulus for answers I mention some approaches which I am currently considering Make application B polling for changes in the tables of interest Advantage Simple approach Disadvantage Lots of traffic especially when many tables are involved Introduce triggers which will fire on certain events When they fire they should write some entry into an       event table      Application B only needs to poll that       event table      Advantage Less traffic Disadvantage Logic is placed into the database in the form of triggers It      s not a question of the       evilness      of triggers It      s a design question which makes it a disadvantage Get rid of the polling approach and use SqlDependency class to get notified for changes Advantage Maybe Less traffic than polling approach Disadvantage Not database independent I am aware of OracleDependency in ODP NET but what about the other databases What approach is more favorable Maybe I have missed some major dis advantage in the mentioned approaches Maybe there are some other approaches I haven      t think of Edit 1 Database independency is a factor for the let s call them sales people I can use SqlDependency or OracleDependency For DB2 or other databases I can fall back to the polling approach It s just a question of cost and benefit which I want to at least to think about so I can discuss it,csharp
I have a IN OUT ratio hit counting system on my site When a user is sent to my site I grab the referrer strip the domain look up the domain and 1 to hits_in Very simple What I discovered thou is if a user refreshes the page the referrer is resent to the site and it counts it as another 1 Whats even worse is that if user clicks on some link on the site and then hits BACK to go to the original page the referrer is resent and it counts as another 1 So if a foreign site sends me 1 user who clicks on a video link views the video hits BACK in his browser and then does this 3 times it will count as if a site sent me 4 users when in fact its just 1 Any way I could prevent the 2 examples from happening without actually logging all IPs and checking access times for each IP before doing the 1,php

I m working in C I want to write a potentially very long formatted string using sprintf specifically a secure counted version like _snprintf_s but the idea is the same The approximate length is unknown at compile time so I ll have to use some dynamically allocated memory rather than relying on a big static buffer Is there any way to determine how many characters will be needed for a particular sprintf call so I can always be sure I ve got a big enough buffer My fallback is I ll just take the length of the format string double it and try that If it works great if it doesn t I ll just double the size of the buffer and try again Repeat until it fits Not exactly the cleverest solution It looks like C99 supports passing NULL to snprintf to get the length I suppose I could create a module to wrap that functionality if nothing else but I m not crazy about that idea Maybe an fprintf to dev null nul might work instead Any other ideas EDIT Alternatively is there any way to chunk the sprintf so it picks up mid write If that s possible it could fill the buffer process it then start refilling from where it left off,cpp

At my company we have a group of 8 web developers for our business web site entirely written in PHP but that shouldn t matter Everyone in the group is working on different projects at the same time and whenever they re done with their task they immediately deploy it cause business is moving fast these days Currently the development happens on one shared server with all developers working on the same code base using RCS to lock files away from others When deployment is due the changed files are copied over to a staging server and then a sync script uploads the files to our main webserver from where it is distributed over to the other 9 servers Quite happily the web dev team asked us for help in order to improve the process after us complaining for a while and now our idea for setting up their dev environment is as follows A dev server with virtual directories so that everybody has their own codebase SVN or any other VCS to keep track of changes a central server for testing holding the latest checked in code The question is now How do we manage to deploy the changed files on to the server without accidentaly uploading bugs from other projects My first idea was to simply export the latest revision from the repository but that would not give full control over the files How do you manage such a situation What kind of deployment scripts do you have in action As a special challenge the website has organically grown over the last 10 years so the projects are not split up in small chunks but files for one specific feature are spread all over the directory tree,php

I recently set up for a learning exercise an Ubuntu desktop PC with KDE 4 2 installed Eclipse and started to look for information on how to develop for KDE I know there s KDevelop and will probably have a look at that at some time in the future Right now however I don t have the correct headers and libraries for creating KDE applications in C C using Eclipse If I have the following include lt kapplication h gt it fails to compile since there are dependancies on other header files that are not present on my hard disk or reference classes that aren t declared anywhere So the question is what packages do I need to install in order to have the correct set of headers to allow me to write applications for KDE 4 2 Are there any packages I shouldn t have Alternatively if there are no packages then where can I get the appropriate files As a corollary are there any good tutorials on KDE development something like the Petzold Windows book EDIT Clarifying what I m really after where can I download the correct set of header files libraries in order to build a KDE application IDEs to compile code aren t a real problem and are easy to get as is setting up compiler options for include search paths and so on Does the KDevelop package have all the correct include and library files or are they separate I guess they are separate as KDevelop is an IDE that can do other languages as well but I m probably wrong So the KDE Qt header files I have don t work where do I get the right ones Skizz,cpp
I have simple server client application that uses JDBC to connect to database and things works ok Application does few simple things with JDBC connection get data insert new line and few others Now I would like to keep the same application but use it outside of firewall so I would put something else on some host port and open that port to outside world instead of JDBC opening database access directly I guess that this problem is faced many many times and sure there are a lot approches One way can be doing servlet on one side accessing it on client side I guess I haven t touched Spring yet maybe another would be to do POJO Java Class and using Spring configure it as http service I have heard also rumors that Jetty has something that can help in this case to minimaze coding on server and client side I would prefer something that is not complicate easy learning path reuse something that is already done What approach would you recommend Thank you and regards Igor,java

I really like the extension method that TWith2Sugars posted here I ran into an odd problem though When I put this into a shared class library and call the serialization function I get the following error The type MyType was not expected Use the XmlInclude or SoapInclude attribute to specify types that are not known statically I looked around a bit and found that the XmlSerializer can only serialize types that it is aware of I interpret this to mean classes that are in the class library not the project that I build based off that libary Is there a way around this Can this function be placed into a class library or does it need to be in each project that uses it Update I figured out what was causing the problem I had the following code object o new MyClass o Serialize This was causing the error When I changed the code to MyClass c new MyClass c Serialize Everything ran fine So lesson learned don t try to de serialize generic objects The thing I liked the most about the link I referenced was that I did not have to put any XML attribute tags on my classes The extension method just worked For purposes of closing out the question I will award the answer to whoever expands on Marc s answer including Marc with a code sample illustrating the use of XmlInclude,csharp

I don t know if my mind is not working today or if this is actually harder than I think it should be I ve got a DataGridView with a DataGridViewComboBoxColumn bound to a generic IList of CustomObjects Here s a rough code sample of how I setup the column DataGridViewComboBoxColumn location new DataGridViewComboBoxColumn Name Location DataSource new BindingSource GetMyLocations null DisplayMember Name ValueMember ID Then when I want to return the value of a cell string id string row Cells Location Value But I don t want a reference to the ID property I want a reference to the actual Location object I ve tried not specifying a ValueMember but that appears to just use the DisplayMember I could iterate through all of the Location objects in the column DataSource and check for the matching ID property however it seems like the ComboBoxCell ought to be able to return that directly Also I can t use a Dictionary in this case Any ideas as to the best way to accomplish that,csharp

One of the things I love about Visual Studio 2008 is the ability to refactor and reorganize the using directives in source code files this may have been in 2005 as well I don t remember Specifically I m talking about how you can have it both reorganize the directives to be alphabetical though with the core FCL libraries floating to the top and removing any directives which don t need to be there either never used or no longer used Is there any way to automate this refactoring the sorting and trimming across an entire old codebase Either through all of the files in a solution or across multiple solution files,csharp

Like most Python developers I typically keep a console window open with the Python interpreter running to test commands dir stuff help stuff etc Like any console after a while the visible backlog of past commands and prints gets to be cluttered and sometimes confusing when re running the same command several times I m wondering if and how to clear the Python interpreter console I ve heard about doing a system call and either calling cls on Windows or clear on Linux but I was hoping there was something I could command the interpreter itself to do Note I m running on Windows so Ctrl L doesn t work,python
The primitive types Number String etc are passed by value but Objects are unknown because they can be both passed by value in case we consider that a variable holding an object is in fact a reference to the object and passed by reference when we consider that the variable to the object holds the object itself Although it doesn t really matter at the end I want to know what is the correct way to present the arguments passing conventions Is there an excerpt from JavaScript specification which defines what should be the semantics regarding this,javascript

I m trying to rotate some UIView around its center so the simple code goes something like in pseudocode UIView beginAnimations crazyRotate context nil UIView setAnimationDuration 1 0 someview transform CGAffineTransformMakeRotation angle UIView commitAnimations now if I set angle to say M_PI 2 the thing rotates nicely if I set it to 2 M_PI well it does nothing I can understand that the matrix translates to something that does nothing rotating 360 means stay in a sense yet I want to rotate it 5 times think of a newspaper rotate scale coming at you effect I m not great at describing hope someone understands So I tried adding setting angle to 180 deg M_PI and add a nested animatationBlock but I guess that since I m setting the same property someview transition again it ignores it somehow I tried setting repeat count of the animation to 2 with angle M_PI but it seems to simply rotate 180 going back to straight position and then initiating the rotate again So I m a little out of ideas any help appreciated t,ios

I m currently translating an API from C to Java which has a network component The C version seems to keep the input and output streams and the socket open for the duration of its classes being used Is this correct Bearing in mind that the application is sending commands and receiving events based on user input is it more sensible to open a new socket stream for each message I m maintaining a ServerSocket for listening to the server throwing events but I m not so sure that maintaining a Socket and output stream for outbound comms is such a good idea I m not really used to Socket programming As with many developers I usually work at the application layer when I need to do networking and not at the socket layer and it s been 5 or 6 years since I did this stuff at university Cheers for the help I guess this is more asking for advice than for a definitive answer,java

I have two threads The producer is producing pieces of data String objects where the consumer processes these strings The catch is that my application only needs the most recent data object to be processed In other words if the producer managed to produce two strings s1 and then s2 then I want the consumer to process only s2 s1 can be safely discarded Of course there s no problem implementing a class that realizes this behavior but I want to use a standard mechanism from java util concurrent if such a mechanism exists Note that SynchronousQueue is not a good solution the consumer will block when enqueueing s1 and will not get the chance to produce s2 In short I am looking for a single element collection with a blocking remove operation and a non blocking set operation Any ideas,java

Here s my problem I have a text field which uses the javascript onkeyup event to do some quiet validation with a tick or cross if the value is valid When the enter key is pressed it does the same validation but with an alert box advising of any problems If the enter key is used to clear the alert box this press of the enter key refires the onkeyup event which restarts the validation and the alert boxes again As soon as I click the OK in the alert box this naturally stops Is there any way I can detect that the enter press was from the alert box This definitely happens in opera safari and firefox,javascript

Today I was thinking about a Python project I wrote about a year back where I used logging pretty extensively I remember having to comment out a lot of logging calls in inner loop like scenarios the 90 code because of the overhead hotshot indicated it was one of my biggest bottlenecks I wonder now if there s some canonical way to programmatically strip out logging calls in Python applications without commenting and uncommenting all the time I d think you could use inspection recompilation or bytecode manipulation to do something like this and target only the code objects that are causing bottlenecks This way you could add a manipulator as a post compilation step and use a centralized configuration file like so Leave ERROR and above my_module SomeClass method_with_lots_of_warn_calls Leave WARN and above my_module SomeOtherClass method_with_lots_of_info_calls Leave INFO and above my_module SomeWeirdClass method_with_lots_of_debug_calls Of course you d want to use it sparingly and probably with per function granularity only for code objects that have shown logging to be a bottleneck Anybody know of anything like this Note There are a few things that make this more difficult to do in a performant manner because of dynamic typing and late binding For example any calls to a method named debug may have to be wrapped with an if not isinstance log Logger In any case I m assuming all of the minor details can be overcome either by a gentleman s agreement or some run time checking,python

I have a database table with a list of products clothing The products belong to categories and are from different stores Sample categories tops bottoms shoes Sample stores gap com macys com target com My customers can request to filter products in the following ways all products no filter by category by store by category and store Right now I have ONE method in my Products class that returns the products depending on the type of filter requested by the user I use a FilterBy enum to determine which products need to be returned For example if the user wants to view all products in the tops category I call this function Products GetProducts FilterBy Category tops I have the last parameter empty because it s the string that contains the store to filter by but in this case there is no store However if the user wants to filter by category AND store I d call the method this way Product GetProducts FilterBy CategoryAndStore tops macys com My question is what s a better way to do this I just learned about the strategy design pattern Could I use that to do this in a better easier to extend and easier to maintain way The reason I m asking this question is because I figure this must be a pretty common problem that people are repeatedly solving filtering products in various ways,csharp

I have a question on the standard behavior of calling tellp on an empty ostringstream I have a function foo which calls tellp the first thing void foo std ostream amp os std ostream pos_type pos os tellp do some stuff int main std ostringstream os foo os In Visual Studio 2005 calling this function with a newly created and empty ostringstream results in the pos variable to be set to an invalid pos_type which in Visual Studio 2005 is set to pos_type _BADOFF ofstream does not have the same behavior where tellp returns pos_type 0 which is a valid pos_type Is this standard conforming behavior Is this behavior consistent with other compilers,cpp

I m trying to use XML documentation on the members of a class and in a certain case I would like to reference a generic type using a tag The problem here is that a warning is generated when multiple generic type parameters are specified It was easy enough to find how to reference a generic type with a single parameter as such lt see cref Func int gt However trying something like this generates the warning lt see cref Func int bool gt It seems that I am either using the wrong syntax for references with more than one type parameter or such references are not currently supported in XML docs for C Strangely enough I can t seem to find any information about this on MSDN or in the Sandcastle docs which I m using to compile the documentation and also complains about the syntax Any clarification here would be appreciated,csharp

I ve been using Java POI for some time now but have encountered a new problem and I m wondering if anyone has found a solution When you read a spreadsheet you need to know the type of cell in order to use the proper read method So you get the cell type then call the appropriate read method to get the cell s contents This works for all cells except for the FORMULA cell where the value is a number If it s text you can read it just fine But if the resulting value is a number then all you get from the cell is a blank string I ve been through the javadocs for POI and am using the correct data type HSSFRichTextString but still no joy Anyone have a solution P S this behavior of POI does bug me as there should be a default cell toString method that would return the string representation of ANY cell type say defaulting to the cell s value property sort of like the paste special where you can choose value PPS As asked I m using Java 6 1 6 0_06 and poi 3 0 2 FINAL 20080204 jar,java

Background I have a small Python application that makes life for developers releasing software in our company a bit easier I build an executable for Windows using py2exe The application as well as the binary are checked into Subversion Distribution happens by people just checking out the directory from SVN The program has about 6 different Python library dependencies e g ElementTree Mako The situation Developers want to hack on the source of this tool and then run it without having to build the binary Currently this means that they need a python 2 6 interpreter which is fine and also have the 6 libraries installed locally using easy_install The Problem This is not a public classical open source environment I m inside a corporate network the tool will never leave the walled garden and we have seriously inconvenient barriers to getting to the outside internet NTLM authenticating proxies and or machines without direct internet access I want the hurdles to starting to hack on this tool to be minimal nobody should have to hunt for the right dependency in the right version they should have to execute as little setup as possible Optimally the prerequisites would be having a Python installation and just checking out the program from Subversion Anecdote The more self contained the process is the easier it is to repeat it I had my machine swapped out for a new one and went through the unpleasant process of having to reverse engineer the dependencies reinstall distutils hunting down the libraries online and getting them to install see corporate internet restrictions above,python
During our work as web developer for a meteorological company we are faced with the same task over and over again Get some files from somewhere FTP Web directory mail and import the contained data to a database Of course the file format is never the same the databases are always designed differently countless special cases have to be handled etc etc So now I m planning an importing framework for exactly this kind of work Since we re all experienced PHP developers and the current scripts are either PHP or Perl we ll stick with PHP as scripting language A data getter will fetch the file from the source open it and store the content into a string variable Don t worry PHP will get enough memory from us The data handler will do the complicated work to convert the string into some kind of array The array will be saved to the database or written to a new file or whatever we re supposed to do with it Along with this functionality there will be some common error handling log writing and email reporting The idea is to use a collection of classes Some getter classes a lot of specialised handlers some writer classes My question How do I practically organize these classes in a working script Do I invent some kind of meta language which will be interpreted and the the classes are called accordingly Or just provide some simple interfaces these classes have to implement and the my users like I said Experienced PHP developers will write small PHP scripts loading these classes The second version almost certainly offers the biggest flexiblity and extensibility Do you have any other ideas concerning such an undertaking,php

Where I work we re finally coming around to the idea of using strongly typed datasets to encapsulate some of our queries to sqlserver One of the idea s I ve been touting is the strength of the strongly typed column s mainly for not needing to cast any data Am I wrong in thinking that strongly typed datasets would improve performance in the following situation where there could be potentially thousands of rows old way using DataTable dt sql ExecuteSomeQuery foreach DataRow dr in dt Rows var something string dr something var somethingelse int dr somethingelse new way MyDataAdapter Fill MyDataset foreach DataRow dr in MyDataset MyDT Rows var something dr Something var somethingelse dr SomethingElse If the properties are really just doing the casting behind the scenes I can see how there wouldn t be any speedup at all perhaps it would take even longer then before with the overhead of the function call in the first place Are there any other performance strengths weaknesses of using DataSets we should know about Thanks,csharp

When coding new javascript heavy websites which order or web browser do you code for I can see these possible orders but I am not sure which I like best Code for one first and get it working well then start testing with other and fix errors as I go This will allow for the most rapid development with Firefox at least but I ve learned from experience that debugging IE with so much going on at once can be a pain Code for both at the same time In other words for each new feature ensure it works with both browsers before moving on This seems like it will actually take more time so maybe do several features in Firefox then move to IE to patch them up What do you all do Edit 1 To respond to a couple of answers here JQuery usage For some reason I was not expecting this kind of a response however now that this seems to be the overwhelming accepted answer I guess I should tell everyone a few more things about the specifics of my app This is actually the DynWeb that I started another question for and as I m developing a lot of the important code seems to require that I use document whatever instead of any JQuery or Prototype functions that I could find Specifically when dynamically importing changing CSS I have to use some similar to var cssid document all rules cssRules found this to take care of IE and Firefox document styleSheets sheetIndex cssid cssRule style element value And I expect that I will have to continue to use this kind of raw coding currently unsupported by either JQuery or Prototype in the future So while I would normally accept JQuery as an answer I cannot as it is not a solution for this particular webapp Wedge and bigmattyh As the webapp is supposed to build other webapps part of the criteria is that anything it builds look and work functionally the same in whatever browsers I support right now I m thinking Firefox and IE7 8 atm maybe more later on So as this is a more interesting and much more complicated problem are there any sites references or insights you may have for specific trouble areas css entities specific javascript pitfalls and differences etc and how to avoid them I m almost certain that I am going to have to have some sort of isIE variable and simply perform different actions based on that but I would like to avoid it as much as possible Thanks for your input so far I will keep this open for the rest of the day to see what others may have to say and will accept an answer sometime tonight,javascript

I ve been learning my way around WCF and I ve got a question regarding the InstanceContextMode Correct me if I m wrong but the WCF will instantiate your object then call the service method on it per call by default You can then set it to be PerSession or Single It seems to me that it would make more sense to have something between session and call which could reuse your object I e if my service were reentrant then I could open connections to databases etc in the constructor then leave the object in memory to answer calls concurrently But in the current WCF implementation it seems that it will always recreate the object no matter what,csharp
How can I speed up site development with a particular CMS if I need to build a lot of sites Should I prepare a few different solutions based on barebone CMS but with pre built components and deploy them if similar site is being requested for production Or should I use some solution generator like Joomla Builder Are there any tools for collaborative development of CMS based sites,php

We have an application that is distribute to a varity of customers Sometime it is installed on a network share Usually we can give that application access with caspol exe and grant the LocalIntranet Zone FullTrust Sometimes the customers admins do not manage to grant that application access due to some network settings When we launch the exe it opens for a short time and appears in the Client Task Manager and disappears silently now the question is there a tool which gives me some debugging or tracing details on that Is there a tool to debug security issues like that I assueme that this happens before any of my code is executed and I do not see anything in the event trace neither on the client nor on the server Any ideas,csharp

I thought I was starting to get a grip on the Python way of programming Methods of a class accept self as the first parameter to refer to the instance of the class whose context the method is being called in The classmethod decorator refers to a method whose functionality is associated with the class but which doesn t reference a specific instance So what does the first parameter of a classmethod canonically self refer to if the method is meant to be called without an instance reference,python

Please keep in mind that I m new to C and OOP so I apologize in advance if this seems like an easy question to some I m going back through my code and looking for ways to objectify repetitive code and create a class for it so that I can simply reuse the class That being said I m not looking to learn NHibernate or any other ORM just yet I m not even looking to learn LINQ I want to hack through this to learn Basically I use the same bit of code to access my database and populate a drop down list with the values that I get An example protected void LoadSchools SqlDataReader reader var connectionString ConfigurationManager ConnectionStrings MyConnectionString ConnectionString var conn new SqlConnection connectionString var comm new SqlCommand SELECT FROM Schools ORDER BY SchoolName ASC conn try conn Open reader comm ExecuteReader cmbEditSchool DataSource reader cmbEditSchool DataBind cmbEditSchool Text Please select an existing school to edit if reader null reader Close finally conn Dispose I use this same bit of code over and over again throughout my program on different pages Most often I m populating a drop down list or combo box but sometimes I will populate a gridview only slightly altering the query My question is how can I create a class that will allow me to call a stored procedure instead of manually using queries like my example and populate my different controls Is it possible to do with only 1 method I only need to start with selects I ve been reading up on IEnumerable which seems like the appropriate interface to use but how do I use it Edited to add I marked Rorschach s answer as THE answer because s he addressed my IEnumerable question I also understand the need for a proper DAL and perhaps BLL layer What I was trying to get to was that I can build a DAL using datasets and table adapters which in the end gets me a strongly typed dataset However I feel a bit removed from the code I was after a straight forward way of building the DAL myself starting with the code that I gave above Perhaps I m not wording my question or what I m after correctly At any rate Rorschach came closest to answering my actual question Thanks,csharp

I need advice on how to return a limited set of data from an MVC controller Lets say I have a class that is constructed like so public interface ICustomerExpose string Name get set string State get set public interface ICustomer ICustomerExpose int Id get set string SSN get set public class Customer ICustomer In my MVC project I have a controller action that returns customer data The project is actually more like a web service as there is no View associated with the data we use the XmlResult provided by the MVCContrib project The controller action looks like this GET Customer Show 5 public ActionResult Show int id Customer customer Customer Load id some validation work return new XmlResult ICustomerExpose customer The above controller code does not work like I want it to What I want to happen is that only the Name and State properties are serialized and returned in the XmlResult In practice the whole customer object is serialized including the data I definitely don t want exposed I know the reason this doesn t work you can t serialize an interface One idea floated around the office was to simply mark the properties Name and State as XmlIgnore However this doesn t seem like a good solution to me There might be other instances where I want to serialize those properties and marking the properties on the class this way prohibits me What is the best way to achieve my goal of only serializing the properties in the ICustomerExpose interface Addendum For those interested in what XmlResult does here are the relevant parts of it public class XmlResult ActionResult private object _objectToSerialize public XmlResult object objectToSerialize _objectToSerialize objectToSerialize lt summary gt Serialises the object that was passed into the constructor to XML and writes the corresponding XML to the result stream lt summary gt public override void ExecuteResult ControllerContext context if _objectToSerialize null var xs new XmlSerializer _objectToSerialize GetType context HttpContext Response ContentType text xml xs Serialize context HttpContext Response Output _objectToSerialize,csharp

I ve read the manual many times I ve scoured the posts offered by Google on the subject I have even bought a couple of books that deal with ZF Now why am I still confused I can using Zend_Form make a form that validates and functions fine What I cannot do it make a form that looks exactly like I want it to look with the error messages that I want it to have I want custom buttons I want funky layouts I want to insert text in the midst of the form etc Does anyone have a simple way of achieving these sorts of things Something that makes me feel like the framework is saving me time rather than costing I could forego Zend Form make my own form have its action hit a page to validate and process the posted data and I could do it about as fast as I can type but I really want to get this and be able to use it as it was apparently intended Any advice Any simple how to s for custom buttons funky layouts and basic or rather advanced as there are tons of basic tutorials that skip over the harder issues getting things done with zend form,php

For my current web development project I m implementing a back end system that will flag errors and send an email to the administrator automatically with details about what occurred Trapping the error and generating the email with appropriate error information is pretty straight forward but a problem arises when one considers certain groups of error types especially if the site is being visited frequently Consider a couple of examples An unplanned database outage that prevents all of the scripts on the web server from being able to connect If it takes say 2 minutes 120 seconds for the database server to come back online and the web server is receiving unique requests at a rate of 10 second in the time it takes the database server to come back online the admins email would be flooded with 1200 identical emails all screaming about a failure to connect to the database A bug in a script somewhere managed to sneak by testing and is of the variety that completely screws up content generation and occurs only in a specific set of circumstances say once every 100 requests Using the unique request rate of 10 second again means the administrator is going to be getting the same email every 10 seconds about the same bug until it is fixed What are some approaches strategies I can use to prevent this scenario from occurring I am only interested in monitoring of errors generated by the script infrastructure issues are beyond the scope of this solution I going to assume that I can almost always uniquely identify errors using a digest of some of the values passed to the error handler callback set by set_error_handler The first and probably most obvious solution is recording in a database and only send the email if a reasonable minimum period of time has passed since it last occurred This isn t the ideal approach especially if the database is causing the problem Another solution would be to write files to disk when errors occur and check if a reasonable minimum period of time has passed since the file was last modified Is there any mechanism to solve this problem beyond the two methods I have described,php

I m working on a grid system which has a number of very powerful computers These can be used to execute python functions very quickly My users have a number of python functions which take a long time to calculate on workstations ideally they would like to be able to call some functions on a remote powerful server but have it appear to be running locally Python has an old function called apply it s mostly useless these days now that python supports the extended call syntax e g arguments however I need to implement something that works a bit like this rapply Rapply server_hostname Set up a connection result rapply fn args kwargs Remotely call the function assert result fn args kwargs Just as a test verify that it has the expected value Rapply should be a class which can be used to remotely execute some arbitrary code fn could be literally anything on a remote server It will send back the result which the rapply function will return The result should have the same value as if I had called the function locally Now let s suppose that fn is a user provided function I need some way of sending it over the wire to the execution server If I could guarantee that fn was always something simple it could could just be a string containing python source code but what if it were not so simple What if fn might have local dependencies It could be a simple function which uses a class defined in a different module is there a way of encapsulating fn and everything that fn requires which is not standard library An ideal solution would not require the users of this system to have much knowledge about python development They simply want to write their function and call it Just to clarify I m not interested in discussing what kind of network protocol might be used to implement the communication between the client amp server My problem is how to encapsulate a function and its dependencies as a single object which can be serialized and remotely executed I m also not interested in the security implications of running arbitrary code on remote servers let s just say that this system is intended purely for research and it is within a heavily firewalled environment,python

I know from reading the MSDN documentation that the primary use of the IDisposable interface is to clean up unmanaged resources To me unmanaged means things like database connections sockets window handles etc But I ve seen code where the Dispose method is implemented to free managed resources which seems redundant to me since the garbage collector should take care of that for you For example public class MyCollection IDisposable private List lt String gt _theList new List lt String gt private Dictionary lt String Point gt _theDict new Dictionary lt String Point gt Die clear it up free unmanaged resources public void Dispose _theList clear _theDict clear _theList null _theDict null My question is does this make the garbage collector free memory used by MyCollection any faster than it normally would edit So far people have posted some good examples of using IDisposable to clean up unmanaged resources such as database connections and bitmaps But suppose that _theList in the above code contained a million strings and you wanted to free that memory now rather than waiting for the garbage collector Would the above code accomplish that,csharp

I m designing a really simple GUI but without any luck Basically the outer layout has two columns which is a splitter pane this is for an IRC client I m writing On the left hand side is the server channel user tree and on the right is the chat pane Now I break this down so on the right hand side there s the output pane at the top and a single lined input box at the bottom This is the code for creating the GUI on a whole this is just a snippet ChatModel cm new ChatModel ChatView cv new ChatView cm treeViewChatSplitPane new JSplitPane JSplitPane HORIZONTAL_SPLIT serverTreeView cv treeViewChatSplitPane setSize 500 500 treeViewChatSplitPane setBorder null treeViewChatSplitPane setDividerSize 3 this getContentPane add treeViewChatSplitPane this setSize 500 500 The ChatView constructor has this in it it extends java awt Container this model model this setLayout new BorderLayout mainTextArea new JTextArea mainTextArea setLineWrap true mainTextArea setBackground new Color 255 255 255 inputField new JTextField this add mainTextArea BorderLayout CENTER this add inputField BorderLayout PAGE_END Now it looks fine initially but the problem I m having with it is that you can move the splitter to the left but not to the right In fact if you move it left you can no longer move it right I did have it working earlier but the implementation wasn t as good and I ve forgotten what I had done Any ideas I can t see why this wouldn t work,java

Context PHP 5 3 x Overview After doing a code review with an associate who uses both php and ruby routinely a fun challenge came up on string interpolation in php compared to ruby Question Assume color orange Ruby puts My favorite color is color downcase ish at least for now PHP print My favorite color is strtolower color ish at least for now Challenge can anyone specify a way to get the PHP version behave like Ruby Caveat This challenge is intended as a fun exercise with the constraint of using only straight PHP This is not intended for serious PHP projects For serious PHP projects the developer will want to consider addon libraries such as TWIG,php
Some context for the question All objects in this question are persistent All requests will be from a Silverlight client talking to an app server via a binary protocol Hessian and not WCF Each user will have a session key not an ASP NET session which will be a string integer or GUID undecided so far Some objects might take a long time to edit 30 or more minutes so we have decided to use pessimistic offline locking Pessimistic because having to reconcile conflicts would be far too annoying for users offline because the client is not permanently connected to the server Rather than storing session object locking information in the object itself I have decided that any aggregate root that may have its instances locked should implement an interface ILockable public interface ILockable Guid LockID get This LockID will be the identity of a Lock object which holds the information of which session is locking it Now if this were simple pessimistic locking I d be able to achieve this very simply using an incrementing version number on Lock to identify update conflicts but what I actually need is ReaderWriter pessimistic offline locking The reason is that some parts of the application will perform actions that read these complex structures These include things like Reading a single structure to clone it Reading multiple structures in order to create a binary file to publish the data to an external source Read locks will be held for a very short period of time typically less than a second although in some circumstances they could be held for about 5 seconds at a guess Write locks will mostly be held for a long time as they are mostly held by humans There is a high probability of two users trying to edit the same aggregate at the same time and a high probability of many users needing to temporarily read lock at the same time too I m looking for suggestions as to how I might implement this One additional point to make is that if I want to place a write lock and there are some read locks I would like to queue the write lock so that no new read locks are placed If the read locks are removed withing X seconds then the write lock is obtained if not then the write lock backs off no new read locks would be placed while a write lock is queued So far I have this idea The Lock object will have a version number int so I can detect multi update conflicts reload try again It will have a string for read locks A string to hold the session ID that has a write lock A string to hold the queued write lock Possibly a recursion counter to allow the same session to lock multiple times for both read and write locks but not sure about this yet Rules Can t place a read lock if there is a write lock or queued write lock Can t place a write lock if there is a write lock or queued write lock If there are no locks at all then a write lock may be placed If there are read locks then a write lock will be queued instead of a full write lock placed If after X time the read locks are not gone the lock backs off otherwise it is upgraded Can t queue a write lock for a session that has a read lock Can anyone see any problems Suggest alternatives Anything I d appreciate feedback before deciding on what approach to take,csharp
I m currently working on a web app that makes heavy use of JSF and IceFaces We ve had some discussions of moving to another presentation layer and I thought I d take the discussion out into SO and see what the experts think I m curious if anyone could weigh in on the pros and cons of the various Java presentation layer technologies If you ve only worked with one say why you love it or hate it If you ve worked with several give your impressions of how they stack up against each other Our technologies under consideration are IceFaces JSF without IceFaces GWT Google Web Toolkit Wicket Tapestry And if I m missing anything from my list let me know Thanks,java

My question is simple how bad is the following snippet of code How would you do it CancelEventHandler _windowClosing private CancelEventHandler WindowClosing set clearEventHandlerList this Closing value _windowClosing value if calling the method with null parameters it will set up itself as the primary control on the Window _windowClosing null null get return _windowClosing private readonly CancelEventHandler CONTROLS null private int current 0 public InitializerForm InitializeComponent these are the handlers for the different controls in the order of appereance to the user STATES new CancelEventHandler handler1 handler2 etc WindowClosing CONTROLS 0 private void clearEventHandlerList foreach CancelEventHandler c in CONTROLS this Closing c private void handler1 object obj CancelEventArgs e if obj null hide every other control but this one also set up if necessary else do something WindowClosing CONTROLS current set the next control to show e Cancel true The point would be that the code wouldn t close a form but instead show another component on it and the set the way to handle that this is mobile platform so clicking OK button on the top generates a closing event This is because showing several forms 4 or 5 one after another to the user makes the app blink and also very annoying while replacing just components is much smoother This model works but seems very nasty and I would like a cleaner way to handle this Update I updated the code sample so that variable names are somewhat speaky Still I m convinced this is awful a but not sure how much and more importantly b how to do it better Update 2 So it seems that the code is still a bit mysterious Now here s what the problem is I show the user a form which instructs him what to do in several languages He proceeds by clicking OK on the window Next I ask for his language and then a few questions where his her GPS is etc like this After he could answer the questions this shouldn t take more than a few seconds each I show him a splash screen I load stuff in a separate thread meanwhile which has a picture Showing these forms one after another makes the whole application start slow and filled with UI lags Here s what I do to work around the lags I put the content of the windows into panels and put those panels one on another and hide every one of them but the one that should be visible to the user current variable Each of the windows does different things so I need to change handler of the window closing event in addition In this code the part which enables the panel is in the same function handler1 handler2 etc with the part which handles the window closing event If the arguments are null it does the former if it isn t that means it was triggered by the user it does the latter I need an extensible solution to this so that I can insert and remove dialogs anytime I want the order and the pointers to the functions are stored in the CONTROLS field and this seems to be very convenient if you actually understand it Although it is never easy to change the entire content of a form there ought to be a simpler way to do this as well a nicer one that is what I m looking for I hope this time I could explain how the model works,csharp
I know that I can use a Mouse callback function for when a user clicks the mouse but what if I want to know the current x y position without the user clicking Will I have to use a different callback that gets called on any mouse movement and keep track of the x y myself or is there a function I can call within GLUT OpenGL to get it,cpp

I am a new php and mysql programmer I am handling quite large amount of data and in future it will grow slowly thus I am using hash table I have couple of questions Does mysql have hash table built in function If yes how to use that After couple of days doing research about hash table I briefly know what hash table is but I just could not understand how to start creating one I saw a lot of hash table codes over the internet Most of them in the first step in to create a hashtable class Does it mean they store the hash table value in the temporary table instead of insert into mysql database For questions 3 4 amp 5 example scenario User can collect items in the website I would like to use hash table to insert and retrieve the items that the user collected Important What are the possible mysql database structure looks like e g create items and users table in items table have item_id item_name and item_hash_value in users table have user_id username item_name item_hash_value I am not sure if the users table is correct Important What are the steps of creating hash table in php and mysql If there is any sample code would be great Important How to insert and retrieve data from hash table I am talking about php and mysql so I hope the answers can be like you can use mysql query i e SELECT from blabla,php

I am attempting to optimise around a possible bottleneck I have a server application that is serving objects from a database to applications remotely who can work with 1 n objects of 1 n different types where n can be a relatively high number that all implement a common interface but may contain many unique properties on different types The client applications store the server objects in a local cache until they are ready to persist them back through the server to the database This is being done currently in WCF with each class defining a DataContract Due to the possibly large amount of objects that may need to be passed back to the server it changes depending on implementation I would prefer not to do these all as individual calls any more rather wrap all the objects in a single serialized or better still compressed stream and send them through as one connection to the server I can quite simply roll my own but would prefer to use a recommended approach and hoping someone may suggest one If you can convince me I am also willing to accept that my approach is probably not the best idea,csharp

I would like to detect on the server side which requests are from bots I don t care about malicious bots at this point just the ones that are playing nice I ve seen a few approaches that mostly involve matching the user agent string against keywords like bot But that seems awkward incomplete and unmaintainable So does anyone have any more solid approaches If not do you have any resources you use to keep up to date with all the friendly user agents If you re curious I m not trying to do anything against any search engine policy We have a section of the site where a user is randomly presented with one of several slightly different versions of a page However if a web crawler is detected we d always give them the same version so that the index is consistent Also I m using Java but I would imagine the approach would be similar for any server side technology,csharp

I have an HTML page divided vertically into Header Body Footer The body in turn is divided horizontally into A large DIV on the left surrounded by scrollbars displaying a portion of a diagram A form on the right The header and footer are fixed height The body should expand vertically to fill the portion of the window not occupied by the header and footer Similarly the form is fixed width and the scroll pane should expand horizontally to fill the window width The diagram is very large up to 10x10 screenfuls so I cannot display all of it Instead I want to display as much as possible using the whole window so that the user needs to scroll as little as possible I also cannot use javascript because some users are necessarily paranoid and must disable it Some options I have considered A table with the scroll pane cell s width and height set to 100 and all others to 1 Doesn t work The table and hence the page expands to contain the entire diagram even with absolute positioning on the scroll pane DIV Absolute positioning to offset the pane from the bottom of the page by the height of the footerWorks but inaccurate the footer s height depends on the current font size and whether text is wrapped This means I must leave a large margin to ensure they do not overlap Place the diagram in an IFRAMEThe best solution I ve found with scripts disabled but limits what I can do in scripts when they are enabled I notice that Google Maps uses a fixed size area for the map when scripts are disabled If Google has given up on this problem does that mean it s not feasible,html
In the Solution Explorer when working with C projects there is the standard filters of Header Files Resource Files and Source Files What I m wanting to accomplish is essentially Filters by folder Lets say the structure of the files was like this Folder1 Source1 cpp Folder1 Header1 h Folder1 Source2 cpp Folder1 Header2 h AnotherFolder Source1 cpp AnotherFolder Header1 h AnotherFolder Source2 cpp AnotherFolder Header2 h SomeOtherSource cpp In the Solution Explorer it would look like Header Files Header1 h Header Files Header1 h Header Files Header2 h Header Files Header2 h Source Files SomeOtherSource cpp Source Files Source1 cpp Source Files Source1 cpp Source Files Source2 cpp Source Files Source2 cpp And I would like to have it look like this Header Files AnotherFolder Header1 h Header Files AnotherFolder Header2 h Header Files Folder1 Header1 h Header Files Folder1 Header2 h Source Files AnotherFolder Source1 cpp Source Files AnotherFolder Source2 cpp Source Files Folder1 Source1 cpp Source Files Folder1 Source2 cpp Source Files SomeOtherSource cpp How would this be accomplished,cpp

I need to implement a simple and efficient XSS Filter in C for CppCMS I can t use existing high quality filters written in PHP because because it is high performance framework that uses C The basic idea is provide a filter that have a while list of HTML tags and a white list of options for these tags For example typical HTML input can consist of lt b gt lt i gt tags and lt a gt tag with href But straightforward implementation is not good enough because even allowed simple links may include XSS lt a href javascript alert XSS gt Click On Me lt a gt There are many other examples can be found there So I though also about a possibility to create a white list of prefixes for tags like href src so I always need to check if it starts with https ftp Questions Are these assumptions are good enough for most of purposes Meaning that If I do not give an options for style tags and check src href using white list of prefixes it solves XSS problems Are there problems that can t be fixes this way Is there a good reference for formal grammar of HTML XHTML in order to write simple parser that would cleanup all incorrect of forbidden tags like lt script gt,html
Is it confusing to design an API with multiple ways of achieving the same outcome For example I have my own Date library which is a simple wrapper around the Java Date Calendar classes to distinguish a year month day Date from an instant in time Instant and provide mechanisms to convert between the two I started off with one method to create an instance of a Date Date valueOfYearMonthDay int year int month int day But then I found that the resultant code using the API was not very readable So I added Date yearMonthDay int year int month int day Date ymd int year int month int day Date date int year int month int day Then I started getting fluent Date january the int day in int year I find that the fluent version is really useful for making readable tests All these methods do identical things and have accurate JavaDoc I think I ve read that a strength of perl is that each programmer can choose exactly which method he she prefers to solve something And a strength of Java is that there is usually only one way of doing things What are people s opinions,java

In a software development class at my university the teacher kept mentioning that on a quiz we needed to make sure that a field returned by a getter needed to be protected I guess she meant that nothing outside the class should be able to change it She didn t give much more of an explanation than that For instance class Foo string bar lt some array contents gt public string getBar return bar Any code calling getBar would be able to modify the elements in that array How do you prevent that from happening I m assuming that the object itself should be able to modify the array just not anything outside the object This isn t homework help since the quiz is a couple of weeks old I simply want to understand Java better since my teacher didn t explain very well Update The teacher wouldn t merely allow us to use protected as the access modifier on the field,java

Customer X has asked for ways to improve the startup time of a Java process he uses The problem is it is not run through a jar file but rather jnlp which I am assuming indicates it is a java webstart application StartUserWorx jnlp Is there a way to convert this to a JAR file and then have the user invoke the application locally and include a startup flag to the JRE to allocate more ram to the process The user is getting a bit frustrated because other workers in the same office use the same application on almost identical machines and yet his process seems to always take a much longer time to load a few minutes rather than a few seconds,java

I have to deal with a library that consists of many templated classes which are of course all implemented in header files Now I m trying to find a way to reduce the unbearably long compile times that come from the fact that I pretty much have to include the whole library in each and one of my compilation units Is using forward declarations a possibility despite the templates I m trying something along the lines of the example below where I attempted to get around the include lt vector gt as an example but it s giving me a linker error because push_back is undefined include lt iostream gt namespace std template lt class T gt class vector public void push_back const T amp t int main int argc char argv std vector lt int gt vec new std vector lt int gt vec gt push_back 3 delete vec return EXIT_SUCCESS g fwddecl cpp ccuqbCmp o text 0x140 In function main undefined reference to std vector lt int gt push_back int const amp collect2 ld returned 1 exit status I tried precompiled headers once but that didn t change the compile times at all I did make sure they were indeed loaded instead of the real headers But if you all say that precompiled headers should be the way to go then I ll give that a try again UPDATE Some people say it s not worth to forward declare the STL classes I should stress that the STL vector above was just an example I m not really trying to forward declare STL classes but it s about other heavily templated classes of some library that I have to use UPDATE 2 Is there a way to make above example actually compile and link properly Logan suggests to use fno implicit templates and put template class std vector lt int gt somewhere presumably into a separate cpp file that gets compiled with fno implicit templates but I still get linker errors Again I m trying to understand how it works for std vector so that I can then apply it to the templated classes that I m actually using,cpp
Following is the scenario i need to solve I have struck with two solutions I need to maintain a cache of data fetched from database to be shown on a Swing GUI Whenever my JVM memory exceeds 70 of its allocated memory i need to warn user regarding excessive usage And once JVM memory usage exceeds 80 then i have to halt all the database querying and clean up the existing cache fetched as part of the user operations and notifying the user During cleanup process i will manually handle deleting some data based up on some rules and instructs JVM for a GC Whenever GC occurs if memory cleans up and reaches 60 of the allocated memory I need to restart all the Database handling and giving back control to the user For checking JVM memory statistics i found following two solutions Could not able to decide which is best way and why Runtime freeMemory Thread created to run every 10 seconds and check for the free memory and if memory exceeds the limits mentioned necessary popups will intimate user and will call the methods to halt the operations and freeing up the memory MemoryPoolMXBean getUsage Java 5 has introduced JMX to get the snapshot of the memory at runtime In JMX i cannot use Threshold notification since it will only notify when memory reaches exceeds the given threshhold Only way to use is Polling in MemoryMXBean and check the memory statistics over a period In case of using polling it seems for me both the implementations are going to be same Please suggest the advantages of the methods and if there are any other alternatives any corrections to the methods using,java

YUI 3 allows you to write Y all foo removeClass bar However it does not allow writing Y all foo removeClass bar set innerHTML baz It seems all the operational methods always terminate the call chain This means YUI 3 only provides half the power of chaining that jQuery provides Does anyone know why this is and if there is a way around it,javascript

I need to load de serialize a pre computed list of integers from a file in a Python script into a Python list The list is large upto millions of items and I can choose the format I store it in as long as loading is fastest Which is the fastest method and why Using import on a py file that just contains the list assigned to a variable Using cPickle s load Some other method perhaps numpy Also how can one benchmark such things reliably Addendum measuring this reliably is difficult because import is cached so it can t be executed multiple times in a test The loading with pickle also gets faster after the first time probably because page precaching by the OS Loading 1 million numbers with cPickle takes 1 1 sec the first time run and 0 2 sec on subsequent executions of the script Intuitively I feel cPickle should be faster but I d appreciate numbers this is quite a challenge to measure I think And yes it s important for me that this performs quickly Thanks,python

Alright this is probably a really silly question but I am new to Python Django so I can t really wrap my head around its scoping concepts just yet Right now I am writing a middleware class to handle some stuff and I want to set global variables that my views and templates can access What is the right way of doing this I considered doing something like this middleware py from django conf import settings class BeforeFilter object def process_request self request settings my_var Hello World return None views py from django conf import settings from django http import HttpResponse def myview request return HttpResponse settings my_var Although this works I am not sure if it is the Django way or the Python way of doing this So my questions are 1 Is this the right way 2 If it is the right way what is the right way of adding variables that can be used in the actual template from the middleware Say I want to evaluate something and I want to set a variable headername as My Site Name in the middleware and I want to be able to do headername in all templates Doing it the way I have it now I d have to add headername to the context inside every view Is there anyway to bypass this I am thinking something along the lines of CakePHP s this gt set headername My Site Name 3 I am using the middleware class as an equivalent of CakePHP s beforeFilter that runs before every view or controller in CakePHP is called Is this the right way of doing this 4 Completely unrelated but it is a small question what is a nice way of printing out the contents of a variable to the browser ala print_r Say I want to see all the stuff inside the request that is passed into the view Is pprint the answer,python

JSON allows you to retrieve data in multiple formats from an AJAX call For example get sourceUrl data callBack json could be used to get and parse JSON code from sourceUrl JSON is the simply JavaScript code used to describe data This could be evaled by a JavaScript interpreter to get a data structure back It s generally a bad idea to evaluate code from remote sources I know the JSON spec doesn t specifically allow for function declarations but there s no reason you couldn t include one in code and have an unsafe and naive consumer compile execute the code How does jQuery handle the parsing Does it evaluate this code What safeguards are in place to stop someone from hacking sourceUrl and distributing malicious code,javascript

How to do conditional compilation in Python Is it using DEF,python
I m working on a service that runs in a java app server farm that needs to do some periodic jobs say once every 2 minutes The service must interface to external entities and it is necessary to synchronize the different instances so that only one of them works on the job at a given time Since the service uses a DB during this job I thought of implementing the synchronization based on a simple DB table id owner stamp where id is the lock s id owner is the current owner and stamp is the time it was locked The methods would be tryLock id maxAge owner to try to lock a record or break an old record refresh id owner to update the stamp to signal we re still around working on the job release id owner to release the lock How would you implement this Edit removed my implementation I ll post it as an answer,java

Am I correct in thinking the following snippet does not work the array items are not modified because the array is of integer which is value type class Program public static void Main int ints new int 1 2 Array ForEach ints new Action lt int gt AddTen ints is not modified static void AddTen int i i 10 The same would apply if the example used an array of string presumably because string is immutable The question I have is Is there a way around this I can t change the signature of the callback method for instance by adding the ref keyword and I don t want to wrap the value type with a class which would work Of course I could simply write an old fashioned foreach loop to do this,csharp
The Scenario I am building a custom CMS for a communications application The users can upload images to the server and then later reference them in posts they write using markdown Images are stored in a database and referenced with a url of the form images id A custom image handler retrieves these and sets a far future expires header so they aren t fetched over and over again Storing the images in the file system is not an option per the customer Posts are stored in the database as markdown and as html for performance Markdown Header Lorem Ipsum dolor sit amet funny cat images 25 HTML lt h3 gt Header lt h3 gt lt p gt Lorem Ipsum dolor sit amet lt img alt funny cat src images 25 gt lt p gt The Problem These images are also editable From a caching perspective this presents a problem When an image is edited I need to ensure that the browser gets the latest version I have come up with the following solutions all of which I have found to be lacking Possible Solutions Version Field Store a version field with the image Increment it when the image is edited producing urls of the form images id version version This is nice if image urls are always generated from the database However I am storing urls in posts as text and would have to preprocess possibly large swaths of text for these requests Also linking an image would be troublesome since a url becomes stale after an image is edited This is probably not a good idea New Url When an image is edited store it as a new entry in the database This means no version upkeep but old links and old posts suffer from the same issues They re never updated The performance would be good but the problem remains 304 Not Modified Store a last edited field for each image When a conditional request comes in return http status 304 Not Modified reducing bandwidth usage This seems like the best solution I ve got so far The image is cached unless edited but I ve never used this approach before If there are 50 images on the page there are still 50 requests to the server Bandwidth will be reduced but the latency remains Is this approach worth that cost The Question I have very little experience in this area and I m hoping all of you have more Are any of the above solutions viable If so what is your experience with them If not what is a better approach,html

I m kinda waiting for a no answer on this question I was interested if you can save a variable at the same time when you checking it in an if clause Let s say I have this code if foo null if foo getBar null Bar bar foo getBar System out println Success bar else System out println Failure else System out println Failure I handling now to failure states independently even if the outcome is the same I could get them together like this if foo null amp amp foo getBar null Bar bar foo getBar System out println Success bar else System out println Failure Much neater code already if foo is null it will stop there and won t try foo getBar in the if so I won t get a NPE The last thing i would like to enhance and the main question Do I really gave to call on foo getBar twice It would be nice to get away from the second identical call if getBar would be a very heavy operation So I am wondering if there is somehow possible to do something similiar to this if foo null amp amp Bar bar foo getBar null Bar bar foo getBar System out println Success bar else System out println Failure I would have to break it up to two different if s again if I would like to do Bar bar foo getBar if bar null,java

I am interested in hearing about peoples experience with embedding mono open source implementation of NET in a C C application How is it to distribute such an application and what are the dependencies I have tested on OS X and mono comes as a huge framework hundreds of MB Do users of my app all need this big framework or can it be stripped down or everything be compiled into the main executable I previously have experience with embedding Lua in a C app and that works really well because I can link statically the whole lua interpreter in with my main executable So I have no external dependencies Is it possible to do something similar with mono Any Lua people here who can comment on how they found mono compared to Lua PS By embedding I mean a C application which initializes a mono environment and loads a NET assembly and executes it and then allows for communication between say C code in assembly and C methods in main executable,cpp

To make it simpler for a webapp to share files with another app on a different server I m using a base href tag in my master page As many people have discovered this breaks webform paths I have a working Form Adaptor class but am not sure how to get the absolute path of the url Currently my program is hardcoded to use something akin to HttpContext Context HttpContext Current value http localhost Context Request RawUrl It is worth noting that I m currently testing on my local IIS server so there s a strange tendency for a lot of things I ve tried using in order what the absolute path do not include the domain name my local IIS is not visible externally Which means it isn t an absolute path and thus the base href will wreck it Is there a good way to handle this such that it will work locally without hardcoding but will also work properly when uploaded to a server I d prefer to avoid anything that involves doing something different on the server side copy Yes I realize I could use separate web config files locally and on the server to get this information but this is ugly and violates DRY,csharp

Okay so I have two classes call them A and B in that order in the code Class B instantiates class A as an array and class B also has an error message char variable which class A must set in the event of an error I created a third class with a pure virtual function to set the errorMessage variable in B then made B a child of that third class Class A creates a pointer to the third class call it C when B initializes the array of A objects it loops through them and invokes a function in A to set A s pointer to C it passes this to that function and then A sets the pointer to C to this and since C is B s parent A can set C errorMessage I had to do all this because A and B couldn t simultaneously be aware of each other at compile time Anyways it works fine however and when I pass command line parameters to main int char it works unless I pass seven eight or more than twelve parameters to it I narrowed it down through commenting out lines to the line of code in A which sets the pointer to C to the value passed to it by B This made no sense to me I suspected a memory leak or something but it seems wrong and I have no idea how to fix it Also I don t get why specifically seven eight and more than twelve arguments don t work 1 6 and 9 12 work fine Here is my code stripped down class C class errorContainer public virtual errorContainer virtual void reportError int char 0 Class A class switchObject void reportError int char errorContainer errorReference public void bindErrorContainer errorContainer Class A member function definitions void switchObject reportError int errorCode char errorMessage errorReference gt reportError errorCode errorMessage void switchObject bindErrorContainer errorContainer newReference errorReference newReference commenting out this line fixes the problem Class B class switchSystem public errorContainer int errorCode char errorMessage public switchSystem int MUST specify number of switches in this system void reportError int char int errCode char errMessage switchObject switchList Class B member function definitions switchSystem switchSystem int swLimit int i switchList new nothrow switchObject swLimit for i 0 i lt swLimit i switchList i bindErrorContainer this errorCode 0 errorMessage No errors void switchSystem reportError int reportErrorCode char reportErrorMessage int len 0 i errorCode reportErrorCode if errorMessage delete errorMessage while reportErrorMessage len 0 len errorMessage new char len for i 0 i lt len i errorMessage i reportErrorMessage i int switchSystem errCode return errorCode char switchSystem errMessage return errorMessage Anyone know what I ve done wrong here It s bugging the crap out of me I can t seem to fix it EDIT okay I have it set up the way I do so that I can use it like this in main int main int argc char argv switchSystem sw 2 sw switchList 0 argumentCount 2 sw switchList 1 argumentCount 0 sw switchList 0 identifier a sw switchList 1 identifier switch sw init argc argv if sw errCode gt 0 cout lt lt Error lt lt sw errCode lt lt lt lt sw errMessage lt lt endl this program is supposed to read the command line arguments and handle user defined switches like how most command line programs handle switches but instead of testing for all of them at the beginning of main I wanted to try to write a class and some functions to do it for me create a switchSystem object with the number of switches set their identifiers whether or not they take arguments and then pass the command line arguments to init to sort it out Then test like if sw isSet switch etc,cpp

Questions What is the best practice for keeping track of a tread s progress without locking the GUI Not Responding Generally what are the best practices for threading as it applies to GUI development Question Background I have a PyQt GUI for Windows It is used to process sets of HTML documents It takes anywhere from three seconds to three hours to process a set of documents I want to be able to process multiple sets at the same time I don t want the GUI to lock I m looking at the threading module to achieve this I am relatively new to threading The GUI has one progress bar I want it to display the progress of the selected thread Display results of the selected thread if it s finished I m using Python 2 5 My Idea Have the threads emit a QtSignal when the progress is updated that triggers some function that updates the progress bar Also signal when finished processing so results can be displayed NOTE this is example code for my idea you do not have to read this to answer the question s import threading from PyQt4 import QtCore QtGui import re import copy class ProcessingThread threading Thread QtCore QObject __pyqtSignals__ progressUpdated str resultsReady str def

Resolution I ended up using the QThread class and associated signals and slots to communicate between threads This is primarily because my program already uses Qt PyQt4 for the GUI objects widgets This solution also required fewer changes to my existing code to implement Here is a link to an applicable Qt article that explains how Qt handles threads and signals http www linuxjournal com article 9602 Excerpt below Fortunately Qt permits signals and slots to be connected across threads      as long as the threads are running their own event loops This is a much cleaner method of communication compared to sending and receiving events because it avoids all the bookkeeping and intermediate QEvent derived classes that become necessary in any nontrivial application Communicating between threads now becomes a matter of connecting signals from one thread to the slots in another and the mutexing and thread safety issues of exchanging data between threads are handled by Qt Why is it necessary to run an event loop within each thread to which you want to connect signals The reason has to do with the inter thread communication mechanism used by Qt when connecting signals from one thread to the slot of another thread When such a connection is made it is referred to as a queued connection When signals are emitted through a queued connection the slot is invoked the next time the destination object s event loop is executed If the slot had instead been invoked directly by a signal from another thread that slot would execute in the same context as the calling thread Normally this is not what you want and especially not what you want if you are using a database connection as the database connection can be used only by the thread that created it The queued connection properly dispatches the signal to the thread object and invokes its slot in its own context by piggy backing on the event system This is precisely what we want for inter thread communication in which some of the threads are handling database connections The Qt signal slot mechanism is at root an implementation of the inter thread event passing scheme outlined above but with a much cleaner and easier to use interface NOTE eliben also has a good answer and if I weren t using PyQt4 which handles thread safety and mutexing his solution would have been my choice,python

I need to debug a web application that uses jQuery to do some fairly complex and messy DOM manipulation At one point some of the events that were bound to particular elements are not fired and simply stop working If I had a capability to edit the application source I would drill down and add a bunch of Firebug console log statements and comment uncomment pieces of code to try to pinpoint the problem But let s assume I cannot edit the application code and need to work entirely in Firefox using Firebug or similar tools Firebug is very good at letting me navigate and manipulate the DOM So far though I have not been able to figure out how to do event debugging with Firebug Specifically I just want to see a list of event handlers bound to a particular element at a given time using Firebug JavaScript breakpoints to trace the changes But either Firebug does not have the capability to see bound events or I m too dumb to find it Any recommendations or ideas Ideally I would just like to see and edit events bound to elements similarly to how I can edit DOM today,javascript

GAE has various limitations one of which is size of biggest allocatable block of memory amounting to 1Mb now 10 times more but that doesn t change the question The limitation means that one cannot put more then some number of items in list as CPython would try to allocate contiguous memory block for element pointers Having huge list s can be considered bad programming practice but even if no huge structure is created in program itself CPython maintains some behind the scenes It appears that CPython is maintaining single global list of objects or something I e application that has many small objects tend to allocate bigger and bigger single blocks of memory First idea was gc and disabling it changes application behavior a bit but still some structures are maintained A simplest short application that experience the issue is a b number_of_lists 8000000 for i in xrange number_of_lists b append b b 0 Can anyone enlighten me how to prevent CPython from allocating huge internal structures when having many objects in application,python

Notes Cannot use Javascript or iframes In fact I can t trust the client browser to do just about anything but the ultra basics I m rebuilding a legacy PHP4 app as a MVC application with most of my research currently focused with the Pylon s framework One of the first weird issues I ve run into and one I ve solved in the past by using iframes or better yet javascript is displaying a dynamic collection of widgets that are like digest views of a typical controller s index view Best way to visualize my problem would be to look at Google s personalized homepage They solve the problem with Javascript but for my scenario javascript and pretty much anything above basic XHTML is not possible One idea I started working on was to have my Frontpage controller poll a database or other service for the currently activated widgets then taking a list of tuples dicts dynamically instantiate each controller and build a list dict of render sub views and pass that to the frontpage view and let it figure things out So with peusudo code Get request goes to WSGI WSGI calls pylons Pylons routes to Frontpage index Frontpage index myViews list for WidgetController in ActiveWidegets myViews append subRender WidgetController widgetView c subviews myViews render frontpage mako Weird bits about subRender Dynamically imports controllers via __import__ currently hardcoded to project s namespace Has a potential to be very expensive most widget calls can be cached but one is a user panel I feel like there has to be a better way or perhaps a mechanism already implemented in WSGI or better yet Pylons to do this but so far the closest I ve found is this utility method http www pylonshq com docs en 0 9 7 modules controllers_util pylons controllers util forward but it seems a little crazy to build N instances of pylons on top of pylons just to get a collection views,python
My server is fairly old based on SuSE 9 and while I try to go through the pain of updating to the latest Apache2 PHP5 and MySQL I ran into this problem with one of my hosted domains The site has an index php and if I browse to their site example org index php it displays fine But if I navigate to http example org or http example org Firefox pops up a dialog asking if I want to save the file or view it in a program The downloaded file is a copy of the unprocessed index php file The config file for the domain has not changed but clearly I messed up something In the config file is DirectoryIndex index php In the DocumentRoot is a htaccess file with only XBitHack on Confusing the matter is that I have another hosted domain with a Wordpress install that also uses index php and navigating there works just fine Here s the site http www sjbridge org or http www sjbridge org index php Mojo Here s some more information When I navigate to http www sjbridge org Firefox presents the file as application x httpd php in the content type but for index php the content type is of course text html,php

I am writing a client windows app which will allow files and respective metadata to be uploaded to a server For example gear stl original file and gear stl xml metadata I am trying to figure out the correct protcol to use to transfer the files I was thinking about using ftp since it is widely used and a proven method to transfer files except that I would have to transfer 2 files for every actual file stl and stl xml However another thought had also crossed my mind What if I create an object and wrap the file metadata and the directory I needed to tranfer it to serialize the object and then submit a request to a webservice to transfer the file Original file size would range from 100k to 10MB Metadata size would probably be less than 200k The webservice call seems like an easier process to me to deserialize the object and distribute the file and respective metadata accordingly However I m not sure if this is a sound idea or if there is a better way to transfer this data other than the two methods I have mentioned If someone can point me in the right direction it would be much appreciated,csharp
DTO I m building a Web application I would like to scale to many users Also I need to expose functionality to trusted third parties via Web Services I m using LLBLGen to generate the data access layer using SQL Server 2008 The goal is to build a business logic layer that shields the Web App from the details of DAL and of course to provide an extra level of validation beyond the DAL Also as far as I can tell right now the Web Service will essentially be a thin wrapper over the BLL The DAL of course has its own set of entity objects for instance CustomerEntity ProductEntity and so forth However I don t want the presentation layer to have access to these objects directly as they contain DAL specific methods and the assembly is specific to the DAL and so on So the idea is to create Data Transfer Objects DTO The idea is that these will be essentially plain old C NET objects that have all the fields of say a CustomerEntity that are actually the database table Customer but none of the other stuff except maybe some IsChanged IsDirty properties So there would be CustomerDTO ProductDTO etc I assume these would inherit from a base DTO class I believe I can generate these with some template for LLBLGen but I m not sure about it yet So the idea is that the BLL will expose its functionality by accepting and returning these DTO objects I think the Web Service will handle converting these objects to XML for the third parties using it many may not be using NET also some things will be script callable from AJAX calls on the Web App using JSON I m not sure the best way to design this and exactly how to go forward Here are some issues 1 How should this be exposed to the clients The presentation tier and to the Web Service code I was thinking that there would be one public class that has these methods every call would be be an atomic operation InsertDTO UpdateDTO DeleteDTO GetProducts GetProductByCustomer and so forth Then the clients would just call these methods and pass in the appropriate arguments typically a DTO Is this a good workable approach 2 What to return from these methods Obviously the Get Fetch sort of methods will return DTO But what about Inserts Part of the signature could be InsertDTO DTO dto However when inserting what should be returned I want to be notified of errors However I use autoincrementing primary keys for some tables However a few tables have natural keys particularly many to many ones One option I thought about was a Result class class Result public Exception Error get set public DTO AffectedObject get set So on an insert the DTO would get its get ID like CustomerDTO CustomerID property set and then put in this result object The client will know if there is an error if Result Error null and then it would know the ID from the Result AffectedObject property Is this a good approach One problem is that it seems like it is passing a lot of data back and forth that is redundant when it s just the ID I don t think adding a int NewID property would be clean because some inserts will not have a autoincrementing key like that Another issue is that I don t think Web Services would handle this well I believe they would just return the base DTO for AffectedObject in the Result class rather than the derived DTO I suppose I could solve this by having a LOT of the different kinds of Result objects maybe derived from a base Result and inherit the Error property but that doesn t seem very clean All right I hope this isn t too wordy but I want to be clear,csharp
I have been working on a project that dynamically creates a javascript file using ASP NET which is called from another site This jquery javascript file appends a div and fills it with a rather large HTML segment and in order to do that I need to turn the segment into a string like so document ready function var html Giving this magazine such a lofty epithet may seem a bit presumptuous but for a non scientifically trained outsider this magazine offers a fresh and challenging look at the fast paced world of science that doesn t shy away from humor and the use of terms and ideas that may require its readers to go online and define a term And in some cases it may inspire the reader to pick up a book on science by such greats as Hawking and Greene in order to better grasp some of the concepts dealing with time space and atoms This magazine isn t dumbed down It includes well placed and efficient illustrations to help explain some of the more abstract points It is not designed in the way popular magazinea are in so much as they only touch upon a topic in the simplest manner and then move on before the audience is lost Yet this magazine keeps the attention of the reader by combining explanatory notes that help people with no background knowledge have some grasp of the topic and by using humor and well written articles to clearly make their points lt br gt For a magazine with a serious and well researched list of topics having small cartoons the likes of the New Yorker shows how comfortable this magazine is with itself From the moment I picked up this magazine for the first time I felt like every word I read mattered and was worth my time to read Not true of many other magazines American Scientist may not have the audience of Discover or National Geographic nor is it as accessible as said titles but for those with a true interest in science willing to challenge themselves and commit to real learning this magazine may be a perfect fit At 4 95 it is certainly worth it to pick a copy on the news stand and try it out divname append html As you can see the segment will be pretty large and I have no way of knowing how big as it is generated dynamically from my database depending on the reviewID which is defined by the user in their request The html to be inserted into the div is a list of reviews and is generated using asp net MVC by a repeater which loops through a list if that helps give you an idea of what I am doing Is there any way to turn this large segment into one string which can be inserted into the append script Thank You,javascript

I ve been running most of my PHP apps on my website on a fastcgi backend served by NGINX I have a new application which seems pretty well integrated with Apache it s heavily dependent on dynamically written htaccess files for example I m working on modifying it to work natively with NGINX but that s not yet ready In the meantime I was going to have NGINX proxy all connections to that path straight to Apache and let Apache handle it However I m on a memory limited VPS and I d rather not run one set of PHP CGI processes for NGINX with their own APC cache and another for Apache using more memory for their APC cache Has anyone had any luck sharing PHP between the two mod_ fcgid doesn t appear to support using already running servers so I tried mod_ fastcgi This seemed to work at first but was sucking up quite a lot of memory committed it was growing not just static Worse I couldn t get the DirectoryIndex line in my apache configs to work with mod_fastcgi I added AddHandler php5 fastcgi php FastCgiExternalServer var www host 127 0 0 1 9000 to my Apache config and all php pages are processed but a path like http example com foo doesn t server foo index php If I remove FastCgiExternalServer then it does find the index php but of course just shows it as text I m assuming it s because DirectoryIndex is processed after FastCgiExternalServer but I have no idea how this can be changed,php

We re trying to read data from 2 usb mice connected to a linux box this data is used for odometry localization on a robot So we need to continuously read from each mouse how much it moved The problem is that when a mouse is not moving it doesn t send any data so the file stream from which we get the data blocks execution and therefore the program can t do the odometry calculations which involve time measurement for speed Is there a way to set a timeout on the input stream we re using ifstream in C and read from dev input mouse so that we re able to know when the mouse doesn t move instead of waiting for an event to be received Or do we need to mess up with threads arggh Any other suggestions are welcome Thanks in advance,cpp

So I found this recommendation but I can t quite seem to figure out how This is the code I originally started with function greySubmits e var value e srcElement defaultValue This doesn t work but it needs to e insert lt input type hidden name commit value value gt This causes IE to not submit at all input type submit each function v v disabled true This works fine Event observe window load function input type submit each function e Event observe e click greySubmits Anyway I am pretty close but I can t seem to get any further Thanks for any help at all Update Sorry I guess I wasn t entirely clear I d like to disable all of the submit buttons when someone clicks a submit button But I do need to send along the value of the submit button so the server knows which button I clicked hence the insert call Note insert does not create a child of the element you call it on And then after disabling the submit buttons I need to call the containing form of the submit buttons submit call as IE will not submit after you disable the button Does that make sense,javascript

So far I ve discovered I can convert incoming BSTRs to ANSI in two of many ways and I m curious to know whether one is better than the other with respect to speed efficiency etc The way I ve been using for a while is use the USES_CONVERSION and W2A macros e g BSTR __stdcall F BSTR p1 BSTR p2 USES_CONVERSION LPSTR sNum1 W2A p1 LPSTR sNum2 W2A p2 Recently however I came across another technique BSTR __stdcall F BSTR p1 BSTR p2 long amt wcstombs NULL p1 1 sNum1 char malloc amt wcstombs sNum1 p1 amt sNum1 amt 0 amt wcstombs NULL p2 1 sNum2 char malloc amt wcstombs sNum2 p2 amt sNum2 amt 0 Now I grant you it s wordier and has two calls to wcstombs but for all I know the USES_CONVERSION and W2A macros may be hiding all sorts of fun and games Which is the more efficient faster code Or is there another technique I could use that would do the job better,cpp

Okay so I want to display a series of windows within windows and have the whole lot scrollable I ve been hunting through the wxWidgets documentation and a load of examples from various sources on t internet Most of those seem to imply that a wx ScrolledWindow should work if I just pass it a nested group of sizers The most automatic and newest way is to simply let sizers determine the scrolling area This is now the default when you set an interior sizer into a wxScrolledWindow with wxWindow SetSizer The scrolling area will be set to the size requested by the sizer and the scrollbars will be assigned for each orientation according to the need for them and the scrolling increment set by wxScrolledWindow SetScrollRate but all the example s I ve seen seem to use the older methods listed as ways to achieve scrolling I ve got something basic working but as soon as you start scrolling you lose the child windows import wx class MyCustomWindow wx Window def __init__ self parent wx Window __init__ self parent self Bind wx EVT_PAINT self OnPaint self SetSize 50 50 def OnPaint self event dc wx BufferedPaintDC self dc SetPen wx Pen blue 2 dc SetBrush wx Brush blue width height self GetSizeTuple dc DrawRoundedRectangle 0 0 width height 8 class TestFrame wx Frame def __init__ self wx Frame __init__ self None 1 self Bind wx EVT_SIZE self OnSize self scrolling_window wx ScrolledWindow self self scrolling_window SetScrollRate 1 1 self scrolling_window EnableScrolling True True self sizer_container wx BoxSizer wx VERTICAL self sizer wx BoxSizer wx HORIZONTAL self sizer_container Add self sizer 1 wx CENTER wx EXPAND self child_windows for i in range 0 50 wind MyCustomWindow self scrolling_window self sizer Add wind 0 wx CENTER wx ALL 5 self child_windows append wind self scrolling_window SetSizer self sizer_container def OnSize self event self scrolling_window SetSize self GetClientSize if __name__ __main__ app wx PySimpleApp f TestFrame f Show app MainLoop,python

I m having a problem sending java util Date objects over RMI to and from machines in different timezones For example a client in Germany will send a date object to a server in the UK User enters a date string e g 20090220 Client app in Germany converts it to date using SimpleDateFormat yyyyMMdd to give Fri Feb 20 00 00 00 CET 2009 Server in UK receives Date over RMI as Thu Feb 19 23 00 00 GMT 2009 Server stores Date into a UK Oracle Database DATE column What is the best way to get around this issue of incorrect dates I could send the date string across and have the Server convert it to a Date but I want to reduce the amount of work that the Server has to do Here is a stand alone test program showing date serialisation import java io BufferedInputStream import java io BufferedOutputStream import java io FileInputStream import java io FileOutputStream import java io ObjectInputStream import java io ObjectOutputStream import java text SimpleDateFormat import java util Date import java util Locale public class SerializationTest public static void main String args throws Exception final String yyyyMMdd 20090220 final Date date new SimpleDateFormat yyyyMMdd parse yyyyMMdd if args length 1 System out println Usage SerializationTest S D boolean serialise false if args 0 equals S serialise true else if args 0 equals D serialise false String filename date ser if serialise write the object to file FileOutputStream fos new FileOutputStream filename BufferedOutputStream bos new BufferedOutputStream fos ObjectOutputStream outputStream new ObjectOutputStream bos outputStream writeObject date outputStream flush outputStream close System out println Serialised date else FileInputStream fis new FileInputStream filename BufferedInputStream bis new BufferedInputStream fis ObjectInputStream inputStream new ObjectInputStream bis Date outDate Date inputStream readObject inputStream close print the object System out println outDate,java

We ve written a WCF service to be used by a Java shop who is using CXF to generate the adapters We re not that familiar with Java but have exposed the service using basicHttpBinding SSL and basic authentication Integration tests show that a NET client can consume the service just fine However the Java shop is having trouble consuming the service Specifically they getthe following JAXB error Two declarations cause a collision in the ObjectFactory class This is usually caused if 2 operations have the same name and namespace when CXF attempts to create adapter classes We can t find any type or operation names that should cause any sort of collision We have made sure that all custom types specify a namespace and tempuri org is not specified anywhere in the WSDL The Java shop suspects the error is because the generated WSDL contains lt xsd import elements So my questions Is there any better way than CXF for the Java shop consume the WCF service Project Tango looks interesting but I don t know enough to tell them to consider using it Is CXF a defacto standard in Java BasicHttpBinding SSL Basic Auth are MS recommended for interop scenarios but the client still seems to have interop problems Should we consider other bindings or settings to make this easier to consume Is there a way to configure WCF to always output a single WDSL with no schema imports,java

In Python I ve seen the recommendation to use holding or wrapping to extend the functionality of an object or class rather than inheritance In particular I think that Alex Martelli spoke about this in his Python Design Patterns talk I ve seen this pattern used in libraries for dependency injection like pycontainer One problem that I ve run into is that when I have to interface with code that uses the isinstance anti pattern this pattern fails because the holding wrapping object fails the isinstance test How can I set up the holding wrapping object to get around unnecessary type checking Can this be done generically In some sense I need something for class instances analogous to signature preserving function decorators e g simple_decorator or Michele Simionato s decorator A qualification I m not asserting that all isinstance usage is inappropriate several answers make good points about this That said it should be recognized that isinstance usage poses significant limitations on object interactions it forces inheritance to be the source of polymorphism rather than behavior There seems to be some confusion about exactly how why this is a problem so let me provide a simple example broadly lifted from pycontainer Let s say we have a class Foo as well as a FooFactory For the sake of the example assume we want to be able to instantiate Foo objects that log every function call or don t think AOP Further we want to do this without modifying the Foo class source in any way e g we may actually be implementing a generic factory that can add logging ability to any class instance on the fly A first stab at this might be class Foo object def bar print We re out of Red Leicester class LogWrapped object def __init__ self wrapped self wrapped wrapped def __getattr__ self name attr getattr self wrapped name if not callable attr return attr else def fun args kwargs print Calling name attr args kwargs print Called name return fun class FooFactory object def get_foo with_logging False if not with_logging return Foo else return LogWrapped Foo foo_fact FooFactory my_foo foo_fact get_foo True isinstance my_foo Foo False There are may reasons why you might want to do things exactly this way use decorators instead etc but keep in mind We don t want to touch the Foo class Assume we re writing framework code that could be used by clients we don t know about yet The point is to return an object that is essentially a Foo but with added functionality It should appear to be a Foo as much as possible to any other client code expecting a Foo Hence the desire to work around isinstance Yes I know that I don t need the factory class preemptively defending myself here,python

I was recently working on a piece of C code for a side project the cpp markdown library for the curious and ran into a coding question that I d like some opinions on cpp markdown has a base class called Token which has a number of subclasses Two of the main subclasses are Container which holds collections of other Tokens and TextHolder used as a base class for Tokens that contain text of course Most of the processing is handled via virtual functions but some of it was better handled in a single function For that I ended up using dynamic_cast to down cast the pointer from a Token to one of its subclasses so I could call functions that are specific to the subclass and its child classes There s no chance the casting would fail because the code is able to tell when such a thing is needed via virtual functions such as isUnmatchedOpenMarker There are two other ways I could see to handle this Create all of the functions that I want to call as virtual functions of Token and just leave them with an empty body for every subclass except the one s that need to handle them or Create a virtual function in Token that would return the properly typed pointer to this when it s called on certain subtypes and a null pointer if called on anything else Basically an extension of the virtual function system I m already using there The second method seems better than both the existing one and the first one to me But I d like to know other experienced C developers views on it Or whether I m worrying too much about trivialities,cpp

I sell a C WPF application targeting net 3 0 at the moment and people keep asking me for a Mac version The application is a time tracking application with a good GUI there isn t that much business logic in a time tracking application so most of the application is GUI rewriting just the GUI is equivalent to rewriting the entire application I don t have the resources to rewrite the application or maintain two different code bases so I need a way to run the same code on a Mac I know I ll have to debug and modify the code what I mean is I can support only one code base I can t split the project into different Mac and Windows projects I just don t have the time to work on two projects Porting the application to a cross platform UI library to a different programing language or to Silverlight are all not relevant it will take too much time and I think I ll get more sales by investing this time in new features Does anyone know of a tool that can run or port C WPF to the Mac,csharp

The syntax sugar provided by Java s enum facility can sometimes be a little confusing Consider this example which does not compile public enum TestEnum FOO foo public void foo helper lt compiler error String name TestEnum String name this name name public abstract void foo private void helper do stuff using this name so must not be static Can anyone explain why the compiler says Non static method helper cannot be referenced from a static context How exactly is this context static You can make this compile by changing the call to this helper here is one confusing point if we really are in a static context like the compiler suggests how can this work or by increasing the visibility of helper to default level Which would you prefer Also feel free to suggest a better question title Edit I found some discussion about this but no real answers My colleague thinks the fact that that this helper works is actually a compiler bug And indeed with newer Java versions it seems not to work although super helper does cannot find symbol helper Although there s something odd going on after trying with different Java versions I can t get this helper to compile again with any of them,java

When reading data in chunks of say 1024 how do I continue to read from a socket that receives a message bigger than 1024 bytes until there is no data left Should I just use BeginReceive to read a packet s length prefix only and then once that is retrieved use Receive in the async thread to read the rest of the packet Or is there another way edit I thought Jon Skeet s link had the solution but there is a bit of a speedbump with that code The code I used is public class StateObject public Socket workSocket null public const int BUFFER_SIZE 1024 public byte buffer new byte BUFFER_SIZE public StringBuilder sb new StringBuilder public static void Read_Callback IAsyncResult ar StateObject so StateObject ar AsyncState Socket s so workSocket int read s EndReceive ar if read gt 0 so sb Append Encoding ASCII GetString so buffer 0 read if read StateObject BUFFER_SIZE s BeginReceive so buffer 0 StateObject BUFFER_SIZE 0 new AyncCallback Async_Send_Receive Read_Callback so return if so sb Length gt 0 All of the data has been read so displays it to the console string strContent strContent so sb ToString Console WriteLine String Format Read 0 byte from socket data 1 strContent Length strContent s Close Now this corrected works fine most of the time but it fails when the packet s size is a multiple of the buffer The reason for this is if the buffer gets filled on a read it is assumed there is more data but the same problem happens as before A 2 byte buffer for exmaple gets filled twice on a 4 byte packet and assumes there is more data It then blocks because there is nothing left to read The problem is that the receive function doesn t know when the end of the packet is This got me thinking to two possible solutions I could either have an end of packet delimiter or I could read the packet header to find the length and then receive exactly that amount as I originally suggested There s problems with each of these though I don t like the idea of using a delimiter as a user could somehow work that into a packet in an input string from the app and screw it up It also just seems kinda sloppy to me The length header sounds ok but I m planning on using protocol buffers I don t know the format of the data Is there a length header How many bytes is it Would this be something I implement myself Etc What should I do,csharp

I m currently using Quartz Scheduler as a replacement for Cron on our Windows 2003 Server Box I have two specific Jobs that needed to be started in a new VM so I m using the ProcessBuilder object in Java 5 to get my Process object The problem I m running into is when our Quartz Scheduler JVM stops the 2 jobs in separate JVM s keep going Process process Runtime getRuntime exec command try while true Thread thread1 new Thread new ReaderThread process getInputStream Thread thread2 new Thread new ReaderThread process getErrorStream thread1 start thread2 start thread1 join thread2 join Is there a way to Kill these threads when the parent JVM associated with my Quartz Scheduler dies Even if I knew of a way to kill them from a different process manually I could figure out how to do it through Quartz Thank you in advance,java
I m upgrading an ASP NET 1 1 app and have things working but am seeing the Javascript error referenced in the title From research it appears that ASP NET is not spitting out the javascript that is used to maintain scroll position between postbacks I did some googling and have checked the various issues mentioned but can t seem to find what might be going on Environment details IIS 6 on Win Server 2003 The virtual directory is running ASP NET 2 0 50727 I have set maintainScrollPositionOnPostBack True in the section of web config Any ideas,javascript
I get a SocketException when trying to call joinGroup addr on MulticastSocket This is only happening on a Windows machine that we have setup to auto start our appliction when the machine is booted up It seems like the exception is thrown because Windows has not completely finished its startup process and here is the exception java net SocketException error setting options at java net PlainDatagramSocketImpl join Native Method at java net PlainDatagramSocketImpl join Unknown Source at java net MulticastSocket joinGroup Unknown Source On startup of our app if we wait a minute before trying to join the group everything works fine So we decided to put in a retry loop so that it will connect as soon as the network is available which seemed to work After two failures the third attempt to join the group works The problem is now the MulticastSocket does not receive any messages from the group even though it joined up fine I am creating a new MulticastSocket after each failure and discarding the old one Why would a failure to join the group on one MulticastSocket affect the one that joined without any errors and how could I possibly work around this,java
I have to process a large byte array that is passed to my function I need to copy the content from this incoming byte array in smaller chunks to an outbound byte array For every chunk of data created in the outbound array I need to call a web service Upon return I need to resume looping through the incoming byte array continuing to pass a whole or partial chunk of data until the complete incoming array is processed i e sent to the web service in chunks I am very new to C and I am struggling with a loop that works I know how to call the web service to handle a chunk but I can t get the looping correct Here is a sketch of the pathetic mess I currently have int chunkSize 10000 byte outboundBuffer new byte chunkSize while BytesRead gt 0 long i 0 foreach byte x in incomingArray BytesRead 1 outboundBuffer i incomingArray i i uploadObject Size BytesRead uploadObject MTOMPayload outboundBuffer call web service here and pass the uploadObject get next chunk until incomingArray is fully processed I know this is a mess and won t work could someone sketch a proper loop to get this done Thanks very much,csharp
I have some Javascript which animates a colour change on an HTML element as follows var element document getElementById someid while i lt 255 element style color rgb i i i i slowMeDown This function runs for a few ms to slow the process down As you can see this changes the color from black to white going through 255 shades of grey in between I would like to make it visibly fade so that the user can see the text gradually disappear However the browser Chrome and IE not tested on Firefox yet only refreshes at the end of the function so the color simply changes from black to white Does anyone know how to make the browser repaint during the loop so that I can see the text fade,javascript

I use the following columns stored in a SQL table called tb_player Date of Birth Date Times Played Integer Versions Integer to calculate a playvalue integer in the following formula playvalue Today Date of Birth Times Played Versions I display upto 100 of these records with the associataed playvalue on a webpage at any time My question is what is the most efficient way of calculating this playvalue given it will change only once a day due to the today date of birth changing The other values times played amp versions remain the same Is there a better way than calculating this on the fly each time for the 100 records If so is it more efficient to do the calculation in a stored proc or in VB NET C,csharp

I realise the second one avoids the overhead of a function call update is actually a language construct but it would be interesting to know if one is better than the other I have been using unset for most of my coding but I ve recently looked through a few respectable classes found off the net that use var null instead Is there a preferred one and what is the reasoning,php

If I call the OpenMappedExeConfiguration method and specify a config file filemap as a parameter does this mean that the ConfigurationManager will use the newly specified config file from that point onwards and ignore app config I know that ConfigurationManager looks for app config by default but because the OpenMappedExeConfiguration method returns a Configuration object its almost as if the instance returned is the only applicable to the config file specified but I m not 100 sure,csharp
Writing a program in c and I want to issue a system command from the system function but I don t want the user to see the command because the command includes a pwd in the executable window I need to copy a file from the user s directory onto the server without allowing user access to the server or displaying the pwd Figured having a exe that does this is the easiest way Ex system FILETRANSFER_SW exe pw helloWORLD11 C temp txt F tempfolder But the executable window is showing this command hence defeating the purpose of trying to hide the password I tried issuing system echo OFF at the beginning of the program but that does not suppress the following commands they still show up in the executable window Any suggestions Thanks,cpp

I have a formview with an insertion template In this template there is a drop down list with a number of items I want users to be able to select from Beside the drop down list there is a button which I am using to add the selected item from the drop down list to a gridview which also exists in the insertion template My problem is that when I click the button to add the selected item from the drop down list the selected item index or value from the drop down list are not available I am using a OnClick event handler to catch the event from the button click but I suspect there is some kind of refresh of the template going on here which I am not understanding as nothing appears to be accessible from the button event handler I don t believe a postback is occurring as I have disabled the CausesValidation property for my button,csharp
Despite closing streams in finally clauses I seem to constantly run into cleaning up problems when using Java File delete fails to delete files Windows Explorer fails too Running System gc helps sometimes but nothing short of terminating the VM helps consistently and that is not an option Does anyone have any other ideas I could try I use Java 1 6 on Windows XP UPDATE FLAC code sample removed the code worked if I isolated it UPDATE More info this happens in Apache Tomcat Commons FileUpload is used to upload the file and could be the culprit also I use Runtime exec to execute LAME in a separate process to encode the file but that seems unlikely to cause this since ProcessExplorer clearly indicates that java exe has a RW lock on the file and LAME terminates fine UPDATE I am working with the assumption that there is a missing close or a close that does not get called somewhere in my code or external library I just can t find it,java

Currently one of our applications is being deployed using ClickOnce and it creates a SQL Server Compact 3 5 database in the user profile Application Directory roaming I am wondering if Live Mesh would enable us to store this data in the Mesh instead Either by storing and accessing the database file directly in from the Mesh or by storing the raw data in the Mesh Is this something that can be done and how or is it something that should not be done I m trying to get my head around this whole Live Mesh thing aside from syncing files Any advise feedback etc would be appreciated,csharp

I have a barcode scanner which acts like a keyboard and of course I have a keyboard too hooked up to a computer The software is accepting input from both the scanner and the keyboard I need to accept only the scanner s input The code is written in C Is there a way to disable input from the keyboard and only accept input from the scanner Note Keyboard is part of a laptop so it cannot be unplugged Also I tried putting the following code protected override Boolean ProcessDialogKey System Windows Forms Keys keyData return true But then along with ignoring the keystrokes from the keyboard the barcode scanner input is also ignored I cannot have the scanner send sentinal characters as the scanner is being used by other applications and adding a sentinal character stream would mean modifying other code Also I cannot use the timing method of determining if the input came from a barcode scanner if its a bunch of characters followed by a pause since the barcodes scanned could potentially be single character barcodes Yes I am reading data from a stream I am trying to follow along with the article Distinguishing Barcode Scanners from the Keyboard in WinForms However I have the following questions I get an error NativeMethods is inaccessible due to its protection level It seems as though I need to import a dll is this correct If so how do I do it Which protected override void WndProc ref Message m definition should I use there are two implementations in the article Am getting an error related to SecurityPermission SecurityAction LinkDemand Flags SecurityPermissionFlag UnmanagedCode error CS0246 The type or namespace name SecurityPermission could not be found are you missing a using directive or an assembly reference How do I resolve this error There is also an error on the line containing if from hardwareId in hardwareIds where deviceName Contains hardwareId select hardwareId Count 0 Error is error CS1026 expected Should I be placing all the code in the article in one cs file called BarcodeScannerListener cs Followup questions about C solution source code posted by Nicholas Piasecki on http nicholas piasecki name blog 2009 02 distinguishing barcode scanners from the keyboard in winforms I was not able to open the solution in VS 2005 so I downloaded Visual C 2008 Express Edition and the code ran However after hooking up my barcode scanner and scanning a barcode the program did not recognize the scan I put a break point in OnBarcodeScanned method but it never got hit I did change the App config with the id of my Barcode scanner obtained using Device Manager There seems to be 2 deviceNames with HID Vid_0536 amp Pid_01c1 which is obtained from Device Manager when the scanner is hooked up I don t know if this is causing the scanning not to work When iterating over the deviceNames here is the list of devices I found using the debugger HID Vid_0536 amp Pid_01c1 amp MI_01 9 amp 25ca5370 amp 0 amp 0000 4d1e55b2 f16f 11cf 88cb 001111000030 HID Vid_0536 amp Pid_01c1 amp MI_00 9 amp 38e10b9 amp 0 amp 0000 884b96c3 56ef 11d1 bc8c 00a0c91405dd HID Vid_413c amp Pid_2101 amp MI_00 8 amp 1966e83d amp 0 amp 0000 884b96c3 56ef 11d1 bc8c 00a0c91405dd HID Vid_413c amp Pid_3012 7 amp 960fae0 amp 0 amp 0000 378de44c 56ef 11d1 bc8c 00a0c91405dd Root RDP_KBD 0000 884b96c3 56ef 11d1 bc8c 00a0c91405dd ACPI PNP0303 4 amp 2f94427b amp 0 884b96c3 56ef 11d1 bc8c 00a0c91405dd Root RDP_MOU 0000 378de44c 56ef 11d1 bc8c 00a0c91405dd ACPI PNP0F13 4 amp 2f94427b amp 0 378de44c 56ef 11d1 bc8c 00a0c91405dd So there are 2 entries for HID Vid_0536 Pid_01c1 could that be causing the scanning not to work OK so it seems that I had to figure out a way to not depend on the ASCII 0x04 character being sent by the scanner since my scanner does not send that character After that the barcode scanned event is fired and the popup with the barcode is shown So thanks Nicholas for your help,csharp
I have a custom object called S2kBool that can be converted to and from a regular Boolean object Basically it allows my application to treat boolean values in my legacy database the same way it treats C booleans Then problem is when I attempt to use a check box to set the value of an S2kBool property it fails Code like this works public class MyClass public S2kBool MyProperty get set MyClassInstance MyProperty true But it s almost like UpdateModel is expecting an actual bool type rather than an object that can be converted to a bool I can t really tell however since the exception thrown is so vague The model was not successfully updated How can I get around this Do I need a custom ModelBinder Thanks,csharp

I have tried translating moving a canvas but I m having trouble with the timers I tried 2 different methods First method was with the BeginAnimation function and the second with DispatcherTimer ticks but they re both very unreliable I need to monitor every step of the translation With the first method I tried BeginAnimation I did the Collision Detection logic in the Changed event and with the second method DispatcherTimer I am doing the Collision Detection logic in the Tick event of the timer The problem is that both are very unreliable In the sense that in my collision detection logic the canvas should stop translating when its TranslateTransform s Y property is lt 0 technically if it is monitoring every step it should stop at 0 every time but with both methods I tried it varies when it stops For example sometimes it stops at 0 sometimes at 1 2 3 and sometimes even at 4 So what s with the discrepancies Why doesn t it monitor every step of the way like it s supposed to What can I do to animate this canvas and really monitor every step of the way An I mean every step every pixel it moves,csharp

I am not a developer but I think that my question is interesting enough and I am desperate enough to post here on stackoverflow My company uses a program written in C to drive a kiosk PC that uses Net 2 0 SP1 and a USB signature pad The signature pad is a HID that uses the generic Microsoft HID driver We tried to install our software on a kiosk PC that uses a different brand of motherboard than we previously used We moved from a Gigabyte board to an ASUS board Other than the brand the specs are identical same north bridge same south bridge same CPU same host controllers etc Also our install procedure is documented and hasn t changed in months On the new motherboard the signature pad is recognized as a HID installs without an issue and the manufacturers software can run the device but our software does not recognize that device is even connected The only thing that has changed is the motherboard brand The manufactures software that can initialize the device is not written in C Any thoughts suggestions or solutions are welcome,csharp

I work in an environment where for historical reasons we are using a hodgepodge of custom utility classes most of which were written before STL arrived on the scene There are many reasons why I think it is a good idea to at least write new code using STL but the main one is that I believe it increases programmer productivity Unfortunately that is a point that I don t know how to prove Are there any studies out there that attempt to quantify or even just hint at a productivity gain from using STL Update I guess I should have been more specific I am not advocating rewriting existing code and I am not worried about the new hires that will get a running start The former would be foolish and the latter by itself is not enough to convince people,cpp
I m storing images as arrays templated based on the type of their elements like Image lt unsigned gt or Image lt float gt etc Frequently I need to perform operations on these images for example I might need to add two images or square an image elementwise and so on All of the operations are elementwise I d like get as close as possible to writing things like float Add float a float b return a b Image lt float gt result Add img1 img2 and even better things like complex ComplexCombine float a float b return complex a b Image lt complex gt result ComplexCombine img1 img2 or struct FindMax unsigned currentMax FindMax currentMax 0 void operator unsigned a if a gt currentMax currentMax a FindMax findMax findMax img findMax currentMax now contains the maximum value of img Now I obviously can t exactly do that I ve written something so that I can call Image lt float gt result Apply img1 img2 Add but I can t seem to figure out a generic way for it to detect the return type of the function function object passed so my ComplexCombine example above is out also I have to write a new one for each number of arguments I d like to pass which seems inevitable Any thoughts on how to achieve this with as little boilerplate code as possible,cpp
In one of my Web Development classes we where asked to create a script that detects NE4 NE6 IE4 IE6 Browsers that display a compatable CSS script for each browser he gave us an article to read about these and the article mentioned this site one of the students said this The best choice for javascript compatibility is to test for browser capabilities when you want to do something One of the main reasons for this is that in the future more and more browsers will be created Now my questions is this which way is the best way to detect the users browser object detection or using the Navigator Object,javascript

I have come to find that using jQuery to create HTML client side can be a huge performance booster if done properly I use AJAX returning JSON to retrieve dynamic content and then I build the relevant HTML and insert it using jQuery The first time I messed with this technique I found that the string concatenator in IE s JavaScript performed really slowly so that building a dynamic table with more than 50 or so rows performed terribly var shtml lt table gt for var i 0 i lt 100 i shtml lt tr gt lt td gt A bunch of content lt td gt lt tr gt shtml lt table gt myTable append shtml Then I found a technique for string concatenation that changed everything Instead of using the sting operator use arrays to do concatenation var shtml lt table gt for var i 0 i lt 100 i shtml push lt tr gt lt td gt A bunch of content lt td gt lt tr gt shtml push lt table gt myTable append shtml join I found that performance improved significantly Now however there is a ceiling of about 100 rows before I start to see the browser itself struggle with dynamically inserting so much content at once Does anyone have any pointers or techniques that can be used to help me achieve the next performance boost for large sets of dynamic HTML,javascript

I try to animate a DependencyProperty from a value to a target value in code and when the animation finishes or is canceled set the final value to the property The final value would be either the To value if the animation finishes or the current computed value by the animation when the animation is canceled By default the Animation doesn t have this behavior and an Animation doesn t change the actual value even if it has completed A failed attempt A while ago I wrote this helper method to achieve the mentioned behavior static void AnimateWithAutoRemoveAnimationAndSetFinalValue IAnimatable element DependencyProperty property AnimationTimeline animation var obj element as DependencyObject if obj null throw new ArgumentException element must be of type DependencyObject EventHandler handler null handler sender e gt var finalValue obj GetValue property remove the animation element BeginAnimation property null reset the final value obj SetValue property finalValue animation Completed handler animation Completed handler element BeginAnimation property animation Unfortunately the Completed event doesn t seem to fire if the Animation is removed by someone calling BeginAnimation property null and therefore I cannot set the final value correctly when an Animation is canceled What is worse I cannot remove the event handler either Does someone know how to do this in a clean way,csharp

eNextBP char Context Rdi for ULONG Frame 0 eNextBP Frame char pBP eNextBP eNextBP char pBP Next BP in Stack fprintf LogFile 2d called from 016LX pBP at 016LX n Frame ULONG64 char pBP 8 ULONG64 pBP This works fine in the debug version but it crashes in the release version The value of Context Rdi has no usable value there I did check for differences in the compiler settings visual Studio 2005 I have not found anything suspicious Trial 2 Using StackWalk64 RtlCaptureContext amp Context STACKFRAME64 stk memset amp stk 0 sizeof stk stk AddrPC Offset Context Rip stk AddrPC Mode AddrModeFlat stk AddrStack Offset Context Rsp stk AddrStack Mode AddrModeFlat stk AddrFrame Offset Context Rbp stk AddrFrame Mode AddrModeFlat for ULONG Frame 0 Frame BOOL result StackWalk64 IMAGE_FILE_MACHINE_AMD64 __in DWORD MachineType GetCurrentProcess __in HANDLE hProcess GetCurrentThread __in HANDLE hThread amp stk __inout LP STACKFRAME64 StackFrame amp Context __inout PVOID ContextRecord NULL __in_opt

AddrStack Offset ULONG64 stk AddrFrame Offset if result break This does not only dump the return addresses but the WHOLE STACK I receive about 1000 lines in my log file using this approach I can use this but i have to search trough the lines and some data of the stacks happens to be a valid code address Trial 3 Using Backtrace static USHORT WINAPI s_pfnCaptureStackBackTrace ULONG ULONG PVOID

anyone implemented such a stack walk in x64 that does only write out the return adresses in the stack Ive seen the approaches StackTrace64 2 StackWalker 3 and other ones They either do not compile or they are much too much comlicated It basically is a simple task Sample StackDump64 cpp include lt Windows h gt include lt DbgHelp h gt include lt Winbase h gt include lt stdio h gt void WriteStackDump

Was wondering what the best WYSIWYG editor that I can embed in a web site based on the ASP NET MVC Framework Ideally it should be Xhtml compliant and allow users to embed images etc The only one I ve used before is the FCKEditor how well does this work with the MVC has anyone tried My main requirements are Xhtml compliance Deprecate as best it can when Javascript is disabled Modify the toolbar options Skinable at least easily change the look and feel Easy to use client side api Plays nicely with the ASP NET MVC framework Edit As Nick said the XStandard editor is good but requires a plug in what are your thoughts on requiring a plug in for web site functionality Thanks Kieron Additional info As Hippo answered the TinyMCE edit is ideal for completness here s there download page http tinymce moxiecode com download php There s a download for NET JSP ColdFusion PHP and a jQuery plug in too Also there are language packs available Been using it for a while now best editor I ve used Thanks all,javascript

Is there any way of writing a decorator such that the following would work assert z not in globals my_decorator def func x y print z EDIT moved from anwser In answer to hop s why syntax sugar DRY It s not about caching it s about calculating z and z1 z2 z3 based upon the values of x amp y I have lots of functions which do related things and I don t want to do have to write z1 z2 z3 calculate_from x y at the beginning of every single function I ll get it wrong somewhere If this were c I d do this with cpp if this were lisp I d do this with macros but I wanted to see if decorators could do the same thing If it helps I d almost certainly call the decorator precalculate_z and it certainly wouldn t be part of any public API I could probably get a similar effect from using the class infrastructure as well but I wanted to see if it was doable with raw functions,python

What is the difference between a static member function and an extern C linkage function For instance when using makecontext in C I need to pass a pointer to function Google recommends using extern C linkage for it because makecontext is C But I found out that using static works as well Am I just lucky or class X public static void proxy int i makecontext void void X proxy vs extern C void proxy int i makecontext void void proxy EDIT I am sorry but I m still not convinced Can you show a compiler or architecture where the static member version does not work and it s not a bug in the compiler,cpp

I have a class that manages user preferences for a large software project Any class in the project that may need to set or retrieve a user preference from a persistent store is to call the static methods on this class This centralized management allows the preferences to be completely wiped programmatically which would be impossible if each pref was handled close to its use code sprinkled throughout the project I ran into another implication of the centralization design in the course of this The software has a public API That API can be provided by itself in a jar Classes in that API might refer to the pref management class So the pref manager has to go in the API jar Each preference might have a default value Upon software startup that default might be computed The algorithm depends on the preference and thus tends to reside near the use code So if the pref manager needs to come up with a default it calls the class in question But now that pref manager has become an octopus class sucking in all sorts of classes into the API jar that shouldn t be there If it doesn t then programs using the API jar quickly run into ClassDef exceptions If it does then the API jar is now bloated as each of those other classes may refer to still others In general do other Java programmers manage their preferences with a centralized class Does it make sense to distribute that static pref management class as part of a public API Should that pref manager be the keeper of the code for determining defaults,java
From MSDN While the SqlDataReader is being used the associated SqlConnection is busy serving the SqlDataReader and no other operations can be performed on the SqlConnection other than closing it This is the case until the Close method of the SqlDataReader is called For example you cannot retrieve output parameters until after you call Close a Why couldn      t you use SqlConnection for anything else After all when ExecuteQuery returns SqlDataReader object the data from DB has already been retrieved and populated SqlDatareader object Thus I don      t see how or why SqlConnection should still be serving SqlDataReader object b More importantly for what reason would it be bad idea to retrieve output parameters before you call Close on SqlDataReader c When above quote mentions that no other operations can be performed on SqlConnection what operations does it have in mind Just those that would require to connect to remote sql server or we can      t use any members of SqlConnection instance Thank you,csharp
I m a total newbie at the net c business and dove in this last week creating a form application to shuffle data around for SSIS configurations The geniuses at MS decided not to apply a key to the table I m working with and generating a composite key of the two candidate fields will not work due to their combined length being too long I don t particularly want to mess with the ssis configurations table schema by adding an autoincrement field So I ve been having alot of trouble getting an update from a DataGridView control to work with a TableAdapter I need the update statement to be update table set a x where b y and c z Can I set the update method of the TableAdapter and if so how If not what to do I see this autogenerated code this _adapter InsertCommand new global System Data SqlClient SqlCommand this _adapter InsertCommand Connection this Connection this _adapter InsertCommand CommandText INSERT INTO dbo SSIS Configurations Staging ConfigurationFilter Configur edValue PackagePath ConfiguredValueType VALUES ConfigurationFilter C onfiguredValue PackagePath ConfiguredValueType But in my form code the UpdateCommand is not available I m assuming this is because the above code is a class definition which I cannot change after creating the object I see this code has a recommendation not to be changed since it is autogenerated by VS Thanks for your most excellent advice,csharp

or are c listviews really such a nightmare to manage Okay the problem I m working on is very simple Or at least it appears to be so I have a text file which contains information about customer orders on separate lines The data items are separated by semi colons My form iterates through these orders puts the item information into hashtables and puts each hashtable into a master hashtable Some summary information about each order product order customer name customer is displayed in my listview separated by sortable columns Below the listview is a tab control with textboxes for the editable parts of the order details spread across three tabs Here is what I would like to happen User clicks on single entry tab control textboxes fill with Order Details User edits details in tab control User clicks on another order confirmation message checks that the change should be committed if Yes then the details should be saved back to the relevant Hashtable and the display in the listview updates User selects multiple listview items the top item should be editable in the tab control User presses Remove Item s button on a tool strip at the top of the form the item s are removed from the hashtable and the listview control is updated to reflect the deletion The textboxes are all set back to blank across the tab control This seems to me like pretty ordinary and reasonable behaviour I guessed that using the SelectedIndexChanged event would offer the opportunities to do the data work But the event fires twice on every selection deselection and it s not always clear which items should be updated in the listview at which point The code for testing what kind of selection deselection has just taken place and decide what action should thus be taken is starting to get quite long and I m just wondering if I m making things too complicated So Is there another event I could use to achieve my functionality goals Or Is there something about the SelectedIndexChanged event that I don t know that would help the program decide what it should be doing at any given point Or Am I just going about this the wrong way Any suggestions even ones about redesigning my form would be most welcome EDIT While trying to attack this problem from a different angle I am changing my master hashtable to a sortedlist The rest of the problem remains the same,csharp

I have a class lets call it A and within that class definition I have the following static QPainterPath path Which is to say I m declaring a static class wide pointer to a path object all instances of this class will now have the same shared data member I would like to be able to build upon this class subclassing it into more specialised forms layering behaviour and with each class having its own unique path object but not having to repeat the boring bits like calculating bounding boxes or calling the painting routines If I subclass it to create a class F for example I want F to use the inherited drawing routines from A but to use the static class wide path object declared in F I have tried having the declaration above in the private section and repeating it in the derived class F and tried having it in the protected section all with no joy I can sort of see why this is happening void A paint this gt path is referring to A path instead of F path even when the object is of class F Is there an elegant way to get round this and allow each class to maintain a static path object while still using drawing code defined in the base class and having all classes except perhaps the base class be real and instantiatable,cpp

This is a follow up question to Is there a basic Java Set implementation that does not permit nulls thank you to all of those who helped with the answer It seems that the way to do this since Sun didn t provide something simple like this OOTB is with a wrapper proxy This seems nearly straight forward What I am wondering is what are the pros cons of the following two approaches of adding a collection or is there another better approach Approach 1 public boolean addAll Collection lt extends E gt c if null c throw new NullPointerException c cannot be null This seems like a terrible abuse of exceptions when all I want to do is check the set for a null However simply running through each element of the Collection may provide much worse performance for large collections And according to the Collection API the contains method may throw NullPointerExceptions if the collection implementation does not allow null elements boolean collectionContainsNull false try collectionContainsNull c contains null catch NullPointerException safeToIgnore Safe to ignore since we do not want nulls if collectionContainsNull throw new NullPointerException c cannot contain null elements this wrapperSet addAll c Approach 2 public boolean addAll Collection lt extends E gt c if null c throw new NullPointerException c cannot be null E a E c toArray We have to iterate through the entire collection to check for a null This won t take advantage of any optimizations that c contains may be using We don t call add e here because if we hit a null midway through we would violate the condition that the set remains unchanged on error for E e a if null e throw new NullPointerException c cannot contain nulls this wrapperSet addAll a Thanks in advance,java

Let s say I ve got a DOM element how can I tell whether it matches a jQuery selector such as p or myclass It s easy to use the selector to match children of the element but I want a true false answer to whether this particular element match The element may not have an ID and I can t assign it a random one for reasons beyond this so I can t apply my selector to the element s parent and look for children with the same ID as mine Will this work as intended I can t figure out Javascript object comparisons selector myElement parentNode each if this myElement Found it Seems like there would be an easy way to see whether a DOM element matches a jQuery selector,javascript

In JavaScript xmlHttpRequest responseXML returns a DOM Document object The DOM Document object is created from an XML structured HTTP response body At what point during the life of an xmlHttpRequest object is the XML string parsed into the DOM Document I can imagine it may occur in one of two places When responseXML is called No need to waste resources parsing the XML string into a DOM until you know it s actually needed When the HTTP response has been received If the server returns a text xml content type it s clear you ve requested XML and you re probably going to want the response body parsed into a DOM as you otherwise can t do much with the requested data Both options have some merit although I m inclined to say that the XML string is parsed only when responseXML is called At what point does parsing of the XML string occur Reaons for asking I need to measure browser based XML deserialisation performance with the aim of comparing this to JSON deserialisation performance,javascript

could some one help me out trying to understand how hard drive seeking works I have a small binary database file which read performance is absolutely essential If I need to skip a few bytes in the file is it quicker to use seek or to read then discard the unwanted data If the average seek time of a hard drive is 10ms and the read speed is 300MB s I calculated that it s quicker to read than seek with a value smaller than 3MB Is true Is there an overhead when performing a new seek which reading an existing stream doesn t have Which do you think be a more suitable file structure for an index Entry1 Value PointerIntoToData Entry2 Value PointerIntoToData Entry3 Value PointerIntoToData Data Data Data Or Entry1 Value Data Entry2 Value Data Entry3 Value Data When reading an entry if the value is not correct it will be ignored So when streaming the file is it quicker to 1 when an entry is not required use seek to skip over it 2 when a entry is not needed read it then discard the data 3 or the use first structure when an entry is required seek into a data repository at the end Entry is 4 bytes value is 8 bytes amp data is 12KB Cheers,cpp

I need some help guidance on WinForms data binding and I can t seem to get Google to help me with this one Here is my scenario Consider the following classes which is similar to what I need public class Car public string Name get set public List lt Tire gt Tires get set public class Tire public double Pressure get set My instances of this will be an object of class Car with a List with four Tire objects Note that I will always have a known number of objects in the list here Now I want to data bind this to a Form containing five textboxes One textbox with the name of the car and one textbox with each of the tires pressures Any idea on how to make this work The designer in VS does not seem to allow me to set this up by assigning to list indexes like Tires 0 Pressure My current solution is to bind to a BindableCar which would be like public class BindableCar private Car _car public BindableCar Car car _car car public string Name get return _car Name set _car Name value public double Tire1Pressure get return _car Tires 0 Pressure set _car Tires 0 Pressure value public double Tire2Pressure get return _car Tires 1 Pressure set _car Tires 1 Pressure value public double Tire3Pressure get return _car Tires 2 Pressure set _car Tires 2 Pressure value public double Tire4Pressure get return _car Tires 3 Pressure set _car Tires 3 Pressure value but this becomes really ugly when my lists contains 20 instead of 4 objects and for each of those objects I want to bind against 6 properties That makes a huge BindableObject,csharp

I have a php script that checks for updates on many thousands of sites On occasion more frequently as the number of sites increases I get an execution timeout on the update of one of these sites and the whole script goes down the drain The best idea I could come up with is to fork each update so if it dies the overall update just continues From what I gathered it seems PHP threading isn t something to rely on especially on a windows platform which I unfortunately have to work on I thought about using curl as a forking mechanism but won t it be much more costly for the server in time and processing power I d be happy to hear some ideas and experience about PHP forking threading thanks Omer,php

I am working on a legacy web application written in VB NET for ASP NET 1 1 One particular page has a form with a number of fields In response to a drop down box changing value I am clearing a number of fields resetting a number of drop down boxes to the first option and setting them all to disabled in the UI To do this I m using jQuery I add a css class to all of these fields and then my jQuery selector is something like the following my css class Here s some sample code to explain var fields fields if some_condition fields val fields attr selectedIndex 0 fields attr disabled disabled The UI updates as expected in response to the above js code but when I post back the page in response to a button click the original values still persist on the server side related to these controls For instance txtSomething is one of the fields with a css class fields so it will get selected by the above jQuery selector The user types 1234 in this text box and submits the form Either the same page is posted back to itself retaining its values or I return to this page and prepopulate the values on the server side for example the user clicks an Edit button on a summary page so the control txtSomething is initialized on the client with the value 1234 My jQuery code clears the value as far as the user sees it in the UI and then the user clicks a submit button If I interrogate the value with a jQuery selector the value of this field is an empty string When the page is posted back and I m stepping through the code or doing something with the value of this control it is still 1234 A very important point to make is that these values are sent back to the browser after being submitted once So picture a form being submitted or any case where these values are bound or set on the server side and outputted to the browser pre populated as opposed to being output to the browser with default or empty values If I load the page as default empty text boxes enter some text and then trigger the js function to clear these fields the value I typed never makes it to the server,jquery

ISO C says that the inline definition of member function in C is the same as declaring it with inline This means that the function will be defined in every compilation unit the member function is used However if the function call cannot be inlined for whatever reason the function is to be instantiated as usual http msdn microsoft com en us library z8y1yy88 28VS 71 29 aspx The problem I have with this definition is that it does not tell in which translation unit it would be instantiated The problem I encountered is that when facing two object files in a single static library both of which have the reference to some inline member function which cannot be inlined the linker might pick an arbitrary object file as a source for the definition This particular choice might introduce unneeded dependencies among other things For instance In a static library A h class A public virtual bool foo return true U1 cpp A a1 U2 cpp A a2 and lots of dependencies In another project main cpp include A h int main A a a foo return 0 The second project refers the first How do I know which definition the compiler will use and consequently which object files with their dependencies will be linked in Is there anything the standard says on that matter Tried but failed to find that Thanks Edit since I ve seen some people misunderstand what the question is I d like to emphasize If the compiler decided to create a symbol for that function and in this case it will because of virtualness there will be several externally seen instantiations in different object file which definition from which object file will the linker choose,cpp

I have some ANSI standard C code which is authoritative What that means is that although I have the source I can not translate to another language nor modify calling arguments as those actions would invalidate the authority There are over 150 functions I can make incidental changes such as change the file names from C to CPP so that it compiles using Visual Studio 2009 s C compiler which I have done Compiler directives and such can also be added I can also go through a wrapper layer if necessary Another restriction is my company does not want me to use the unsafe key word in any C code I need to get at these functions from a C program A typical C C function looks like this double SomeFunction double a double 3 vec double 3 3 mat Where the array contents are sometimes input sometimes output and rarely both I first tried making an unmanaged DLL with the functions marked Extern C Functions with only simple arguments int double worked fine but I could not determine how to Marshal the arrays Actually I did find some sample code but it was extremely complex and unreasonable to duplicate 150 times I then tried two projects within the same solution one in C and the other in C In the C project I created a managed function which just called the original function which was marked as unmanaged This was extremely clean and simple and again simple arguments worked fine But for arrays I couldn t find how to make the argument types match across the C to C boundary Argument 2 cannot convert from double to double and as mentioned above I can t use unsafe to get a pointer Certainly what I am trying to do must be possible What is the best way to get at these functions Sample code using the above function would be really cool,csharp

I know there are a few post out here about selecting records until a certain number is met from the sum of one field but there isn t any that suits me I m using PHP and MySQL I have a table named quantity Inside there are records of product name product price and product quantity Besides these there are a few others that helps me select the last records based on date and position aswell as a GROUP BY the field named price because there are different quantities with different prices for the same product So I currently select my product specific price and quantity like this SELECT price quantity FROM SELECT price quantity FROM quantity WHERE product_name DELL ORDER BY date DESC position AS Actions GROUP BY price This query is a workaround because I need to get data like this product_name price quantity DELL 100 30 DELL 120 10 DELL 130 2 asuming that I have multiple records like these and I need to get the latest of them Anyway from this query I need to do the following I need to select the records who s quantity summed with another product s quantity equals 35 So by using my query I know that it should stop at line 2 because I can take the 30 products that came with the price of 100 and another 5 products from the line 2 that has price of 120 And then I would need to enter my updates So the new data would look like product_name price quantity DELL 100 0 DELL 120 5 DELL 130 2 How in the world am I going to achieve this I hope my details are clear Please ask any question Thank you for your time,php

After posting this a while back I decided to create my own Registration Authentication capability in PHP I d love anyone to point out the flaws opportunities for improvement particularly around what s stored in the session The logical flow is 1 User Registers using email as username a site name which then forms part of any url which they will have access to and a password of at least 6 characters which must contain letters and numbers I know this could be stronger 2 Provided the user and site are unique I then store both of those along with a randomly generated string salt in a row in the auth table in my database I then take the users password concatenate the salt to it and store an md5 hash of this salted password in the same database row 3 When a user then logs in I take the password she s entered and concatenate the salt to it create an md5 hash of that and compare it to what I have stored in the database if they match the user has entered the right password and their username is written to the session 4 On every request I use the username stored in the session to query the database and read the site name associated with this user I then compare this to the site name in the url itself and if they match I set a variable which is accessible to the rest or of the script not a global variable it s just readable by my controller which decides if a user can see a particular page if the two site names don t match the user is redirected back to login My concern is could someone write to the session and thus be able to access peoples pages if they know the username they signed up with How would you go about preventing this Before anyone accuses me of negligence by the way this is a personal project for learning I m not exposing any clients data,php

I m trying to parse the title tag in an RSS 2 0 feed into three different variables for each entry in that feed Using ElementTree I ve already parsed the RSS so that I can print each title minus the trailing with the code below feed getfeed http www tourfilter com dallas rss by_concert_date for item in feed print repr item title 0 1 I include that because as you can see the item title is a repr data type which I don t know much about A particular repr item title 0 1 printed in the interactive window looks like this randy travis Billy Bobs 3 21 Michael Schenker Group House of Blues Dallas 3 26 The user selects a band and I hope to after parsing each item title into 3 variables one each for band venue and date or possibly an array or I don t know select only those related to the band selected Then they are sent to Google for geocoding but that s another story I ve seen some examples of regex and I m reading about them but it seems very complicated Is it I thought maybe someone here would have some insight as to exactly how to do this in an intelligent way Should I use the re module Does it matter that the output is currently is repr s Is there a better way I was thinking I d use a loop like and this is my pseudoPython just kind of notes I m writing list bandRaw venue date latLong for item in feed parse item title for bandRaw venue date if bandRaw str band send venue name Dallas TX to google for geocoding return lat long list list return character bandRaw venue date lat long else In the end I need to have the chosen entries in a csv comma delimited file looking like this band venue date lat long randy travis Billy Bobs 3 21 1234 5678 1234 5678 Michael Schenker Group House of Blues Dallas 3 26 4321 8765 4321 8765 I hope this isn t too much to ask I ll be looking into it on my own just thought I should post here to make sure it got answered So the question is how do I best parse each repr item title 0 1 in the feed into the 3 separate values that I can then concatenate into a csv file,python

I have some data that must be presented in tabular form with multiple sections In particular Each section of data is broken up with it s own headers by day This is basically a one off single page deal and won t really be maintained so I don t want to put a lot of effort into architecture I have two tables HEADERS and ITEMS HEADERS have a format of date datetime type tinyint firstline varchar secondline varchar ITEMS has a format of id int date datetime type tinyint name varchar value1 int value2 int value3 int I need the data to look similar to this first and secondline are data populated third line is static text item lines are data populated 1 1 2009 First line Second line Date Name Value 1 Value 2 Value 3 Date Name Value 1 Value 2 Value 3 Date Name Value 1 Value 2 Value 3 1 2 2009 First line Second line Date Name Value 1 Value 2 Value 3 Date Name Value 1 Value 2 Value 3 Date Name Value 1 Value 2 Value 3 This will repeat for all days currently in the database each day having it s own table with it s own headers They will also be filtered by type the page will only show headers and items of the type specified Type is an tinyint So the question is What is the best ASP NET elements to use DataList GridView And how do I include the data from two tables in a header item format EDIT Sorry forgot to mention that this has to work on Windows 2000 IIS5 so i m stuck with ASP NET 2 0 and can t use 3 0 or 3 5 features,csharp

Is it possible to authenticate users across sub domains when the authentication takes place at a sub domain instead of the parent domain For example User logs into site1 parent com and then we need to send them to reporting parent com Can I authenticate them to the reporting site even though the log in occured at a sub domain So far all of the research I have done has users logging into the parent domain first and then each sub domain has access to the authentication cookie,csharp
Last week I wrote a few lines of code in C to fire up a large text file 300 000 lines into a Dictionary It took ten minutes to write and it executed in less than a second Now I m converting that piece of code into C because I need it in an old C COM object I ve spent two days on it this far Although the productivity difference is shocking on its own it s the performance that I would need some advice on It takes seven seconds to load and even worse it takes just exactly that much time to free all the CStringWs afterwards This is not acceptable and I must find a way to increase the performance Are there any chance that I can allocate this many strings without seeing this horrible performace degradation My guess right now is that I ll have to stuff all the text into a large array and then let my hash table point to the beginning of each string within this array and drop the CStringW stuff But before that any advice from you C experts out there EDIT My answer to myself is given below I realized that that is the fastest route for me and also step in what I consider the right direction towards more managed code,cpp

What I am trying to achieve After each view has finished executing I would like to make a separate http call to an external partner I need to pass one of the view s content as body of that http call What I have so far I have a base controller from which all of my controllers inherit from I have found that i can override the onActionExecuted method of the base controller and write my partner http call code there so that it will be executed after each action I have written a custom result after reading the article at http stackoverflow com questions 520863 send asp net mvc action result inside email which enables me to grab the content of the view which is part of another controller that also inherits from base controller What I can t figure out How do I make a call to the controller action the one that will render the content for the http calls body to get the content in my base controller onActionExecuted method anil,csharp

The project I m working on has just hit 4200 lines in the main C file which is causing Intellisense to take a few seconds sometimes up to 6 or so to respond during which Visual Studio locks up I m wondering how everyone else splits their files and whether there s a consensus I tried to look for some guides and found Google s C guide but I couldn t see anything about semantics such as function sizes and file sizes maybe it s there I haven t looked at it for a while So how do you split your files Do you group your methods by the functions they serve By types event handlers private public And at what size limit do you split functions Edit To clarify the application in question handles data so it s interface is a big ass grid and everything revolves around the grid It has a few dialogs forms for management but it s all about the data The reason why it s so big as there is a lot of error checking event handling and also the grid set up as master detail with 3 more grid for each row but these load on master row expanded I hope this helps to clarify what I m on about,csharp

If you plan to write a very computationally intensive parallel application what guidelines would you use to design your objects whether classes or structs or anything else to maximize your potential of getting the most out of the parallelism I am thinking of an application that say interprets compiles a tree like graph of objects that require creating stuff passing it to another object to be processed and so on with tree like structure What should one consider from the early design process,csharp

I have a wizard style HTML form with a row of submit buttons for the Back Next Cancel actions in that order The form can also contain a varying number of input fields such as text fields radio buttons checkboxes dropdowns select tags and textareas The customer requires the Next button to be the default action so that if the user types into a text field and presses Enter it should submit the form as if they had clicked the Next button The problem is that in this scenario the browser at least IE which is what 99 of our customers use submits the form using the first button declared in the form which as you can see from the above list is Back not Next as desired One fix I read about is to declare the Back and Next buttons in reverse order i e Next first then use CSS to display them around the right way like so lt html gt lt head gt lt style type text css gt formSubmitButtons direction rtl float left formSubmitButtons input direction ltr float none lt style gt lt head gt lt body gt lt form action blah method POST enctype application x www form urlencoded gt lt div class formSubmitButtons gt lt input type submit name btnNext value Next gt lt input type submit name btnBack value Back gt lt div gt lt input type submit name btnCancel value Cancel gt lt br gt Some text fields go here lt form gt lt body gt lt html gt This provides the desired behaviour and button order in both Firefox and IE however the spacing of the Cancel button relative to the others is inconsistent In IE6 it looks nice enough but in Firefox 3 0 5 the Cancel button is jammed up against the Next button Does anyone know what CSS magic I need to weave in order to get these three buttons to space evenly in both browsers avoiding the issue by sorting the buttons Next Back Cancel is not an option also thanks to everyone who suggested JavaScript based solutions but not all our customers allow JS so it has to be a straight HTML and or CSS solution Here s what I ended up doing that worked nicely based on Cletus s suggestion lt lt input type submit name btnNext style position absolute left 9999px tabindex 1 gt lt input type submit name btnBack value Back gt lt input type submit name btnNext value Next gt lt input type submit name btnCancel value Cancel gt gt ignore the wrapping comment tags they re just so you can see the HTML,html

We are currently discussing whether Extension methods in NET are bad or not Or under what circumstances Extension methods can introduce hard to find bugs or in any other way behave unexpectedly We came up with Writing an extension method for types that are not under your control e g extending DirectoryInfo with GetTotalSize etc is bad because the owner of the API could introduce a method that hides our extension and might have different edge cases For example testing for null in an extension method will automatically translate into a NullReferenceException if the extension method is no longer used due to hiding Question Are there any other dangerous situations than hiding that we are not thinking of Edit Another very dangerous situation Suppose you have an extension method namespace Example ExtensionMethods public static class Extension public static int Conflict this TestMe obj return 1 And use it namespace Example ExtensionMethods Conflict Test TestFixture public class ConflictExtensionTest Test public void ConflictTest TestMe me new TestMe int result me Conflict Assert That result Is EqualTo 1 Notice that the namespace where you use it is longer Now you reference a dll with this namespace Example ExtensionMethods Conflict public static class ConflictExtension public static int Conflict this TestMe obj return 1 And your Test will fail It will compile without a compiler error It will simply fail Without you even having to specify using Example ExtensionMethods Conflict The compiler will walk the namespace name and find Example ExtensionMethods Conflict ConflictExtension before Example ExtensionMethods Extension and will use that without ever complaining about ambiguous extension methods Oh the horror,csharp

I am in a situation where I need to allow a user to download a file dynamically determined from the URL Before the download begins I need to do some authentication so the download has to run through a script first All files would be stored outside of the web root to prevent manual downloading For example any of the following could be download links http example com downloads companyxyz overview pdf http example com downloads companyxyz images logo png http example com downloads companyxyz present ppt presentation ppt Basically the folder depth can vary To prevent a directory traversal like say http example com downloads etc passwd I need to obviously do some checking on the URI Note I do not have the option of storing this info in a database the URI must be used Would the following regexp be bullet proof in making sure that a user doesnt enter something fishy preg_match _ w _ w zip gif jpg png pdf ppt png iD path What other options of making sure the URI is sane do I have Possibly using realpath in PHP,php
According to the java api the InputStream read is described as If no byte is available because the end of the stream has been reached the value 1 is returned This method blocks until input data is available the end of the stream is detected or an exception is thrown I have a while true loop doing a read and I always get 1 when nothing s sent over the stream That s expected My question is when would read ever block Since if it doesn t get any data it returns 1 I would expect a blocking read to wait until data is received If you ve reached the end of the input stream shouldn t read simply wait for data instead of returning 1 Or does read only block if there s another thread accessing the stream and your read cannot access the stream Which leads me to my next question I used to have event listener provided by my library that would notify me when data is available When I was notified I would call while aByte read gt 1 store the byte I was puzzled when I d get TWO events in very close time proximity and not all my data was being displayed It seemed like only the tail end of the second event s data would be displayed and the the rest was missing I eventually changed my code so that when I get an event I d called if inputStream available gt 0 while aByte read gt 1 store the byte Now it worked properly and all my data was displayed Can someone explain this behavior The InputStream available is said to return the number of bytes you can read before blocking the next caller of the stream Even if I don t use available I would expect the read of the first event to just block the read of the second event but not erase or consume too much stream data Why would doing this cause not all of my data to be displayed,java
I am working on a small text editor project and want to add basic syntax highlighting for a couple of languages Java XML just to name a few As a learning experience I wanted to add one of the popular or non popular Java lexer parser What project do you recommend Antlr is probably the most well known but it seems pretty complex and heavy Here are the option that I know of Antlr Ragel yes it can generate Java source for processing input Do it yourself I guess I could write a simple token parser and highlight the source code,java

Currently I m using XmlSerializer to serialize and deserialize an object The xml is generated in an undefined order which is understandable but makes it annoying when comparing versions of the object since the order of properties is different each time So for instance I can t use a normal diff tool to see any differences Is there an easy way to generate my xml in the same order every time without writing the ReadXml and WriteXml methods myself I have a lot of properties on the class and add new ones every now and again so would prefer to not have to write and then maintain that code C net 2 0,csharp

I have a property grid that helps me manage all of the controls on a form These controls are for designer type folks so I m not really worried that much about the user interface until someone selects multiple objects I have a UITypeEditor for the BottomDiameter property on these common objects It keeps track of units meters vs feet and does some nice things on the fly However when someone selects two or three common objects BottomDiameter is blank even though it evaluates to the same text string The reason I think that it is blank is that it is actually three separate objDiameter objects How can I tell the property grid to behave like all of the other properties and show the value if it evaluates to the same string UPDATE For example the Anchor property has a text output of Top Right but when you pull it down it is an object Yet when you select five objects on your form that all have the same Anchor setting you can still see the string Top Right in the property grid,csharp
The destructor should only release unmanaged resources that your object holds on to and it should not reference other objects If you have only managed references you do not need to and should not implement a destructor You want this only for handling unmanaged resources Because there is some cost to having a destructor you ought to implement this only on methods that consume valuable unmanaged resources Top Ten Traps in C for C Programmers The article doesn t go into this in more depth but what sorts of costs are involved with using a destructor in C Note I know about the GC and the fact the destructor isn t called at reliable times that all aside is there anything else,csharp

My application produces an xml file that is then xslt transformed into a nice html report I have a problem with n however There are some xslt techniques to do it but they are pretty awkward and time consuming So my solution was to do a string replace n to lt br and then to force the xmlWriter to write this with WriteRaw text The problem is that the text sometimes has some illegal chars like I am unable to find any utility method in net that just takes in a string and transforms it in a xml friendly string I looked with the reflector and the class that handles this logic is not public Any ideeas beside writing my own code to do this,csharp

I m trying to read raw video frames from a video capture device using JMF the Java Media Framework I ve successfully written the capture part using a Player object created by Manager I can display realtime video from a webcam I don t know how to go about creating a custom component to access the actual frames however This is probably because up until now Manager has created every class instance I needed for me I would like to start by writing a GUI component that displays the video I m not familiar with AWT Swing but based on knowledge of other GUI frameworks I d say something derived from a say JPanel that draws the video when a repaint request is made or a new frame is available I would like to be able to process every new frame and loop on x y over all the pixels I have access to the raw RGB format on my device but automatic conversion from say YUV wouldn t hurt I have no idea where to start The JMF documentation recommends I derive my class from Processor or DataSink in several different places Using the Processor interface seems like an overkill I would have no need for the playback and timing control functions for example and I wouldn t know how to implement them in the first place Deriving from DataSink seems like a simpler option with less useless abstract functions However in either case I m at a complete loss as how to a Connect the component to my video capture DataSource b Access the actual frame buffers from within the class I may even be going in a wrong direction here I just wanted to document what I ve tried so far JMF documentation seems scarce and mostly oriented towards designing media players and converters Note The Processing library seems to have a simple solution for this I ve seen an example along the lines of x new Image captureDevice getFrame which seems to suggest pixel level access is possible through Image if not the intermediate type But I would really like to see how hard it is in JMF first,java

In response to a question I asked a few days ago I m attempting to stretch myself a little and do something that I ve not really focussed on much before I ve done some searching both here and in general but can t find the answers or even reasonable hints to what I want to achieve though a few things come close ish Basically I m trying to deserialize the data for the Google Chrome bookmarks file using the Json NET library though if there s a better alternative I m all for that the documentation for this library is a little confusing in places I m a little confused as to the next step to take due primarily to being used to PHP s fantastic handling of JSON data using json_decode allowing for a single function call and then simple associative array access The library Json NET wants me to specify an Object type that it can deserialize the JSON data into but I m not really sure how to go about structuring such an Object given the format of the Bookmarks file itself The format is something along the lines of roots bookmark_bar children children date_added 12880758517186875 name Example URL type url url http example com date_added 12880290253039500 name Another URL type url url http example org date_added 12880772259603750 date_modified 12880772452901500 name Sample Folder type folder date_added 12880823826333250 name Json NET type url url http james newtonking com pages json net aspx date_added 0 date_modified 12880823831234250 name Bookmarks bar type folder other children date_added 0 date_modified 0 name Other bookmarks type folder version 1 Now in PHP I d be far more used to doing something along the lines of the following to get the data I wanted and ending up with Json NET data roots bookmark_bar children 0 name I can work out simply enough what objects to create to represent the data something like a root object then a bookmark list object and finally an individual bookmark object but I m really not sure as to how to implement them and then get the library to deserialize into the relevant objects correctly Any advice that can be offered would be greatly appreciated,csharp

Thus far this is what I ve tried I m using Firefox 3 07 Make sure in about config that the property browser cache check_doc_frequency is set to 1 which the browser interprets as check for a new page every time Make sure in about config that the property security fileuri strict_origin_policy is set to false When opening your browser be sure to specify to the testrunner html page which test you want to run using the testpage parameter I E file testRunner html testpage c temp someTest html Tak an additional random parameter on the end to ensure that the cache is gone Everything above seems to work except it is still caching my js files for some stupid reason I really thought it would have had to do with changing the random parameter at the end to kill the cache but that doesn t seem to be doing the trick What else can be done to make JSUnit work with Firefox 3 07 The files are located on my hdd,javascript

I have a class with a static method that looks roughly like class X static float getFloat MyBase amp obj return obj value MyBase value is virtual I m calling it with an instance of MyDerived which subclasses MyBase MyDerived d float f X getFloat d If I link the obj file containing X into my executable everything works as expected If I m expecting to get 3 14 I get it If I create a lib that contains the X obj file and link in the lib it breaks When I call getFloat it s returning 1 IND00 Is this some type of sentinel value that should tell me what s wrong here Is anything different when you link in a lib rather than an obj directly I don t get any compiler warnings or errors Edit I m using Visual Studio 2005 on Windows XP Pro SP3 To make sure I wasn t linking old files I cloned the value method into a new value2 method and called that instead The behavior was the same Edit 2 So if I trace into the call with my debugger I m finding that it isn t going into my value method at all Instead it s going into a different unrelated method This makes me think my vtable is corrupted I think the behavior I m seeing must be a side effect of some other problem Solved thanks to Vlad It turns out I was violating the one definition rule ODR although it wasn t evident from the code I posted This is a great article from the Visual C guys that explains the problem and one way to track it down The d1reportSingleClassLayout compiler flag is a fantastic learning tool When I dumped out the my class layout for MyBase and MyDerived in the two different projects I found differences between the calling code and the library code It turns out I had some ifdef blocks in my header files and the corresponding define statement was in the precompiled header for the main project but not in the subproject the library Have I mentioned how evil I think preprocessor macros are Anyway I m only posting this stuff because it might be helpful to somebody else This question was also very helpful to me,cpp

I decided to leave my windows install behind and am now running Debian as my default OS I have always coded in Windows and specifically with Visual Studio I am currently trying to get used to compiling my code under linux Although I still have a lot of documentation to read and don t expect you guys to make it too easy for me it d still be nice to get some pointers on where to start I have some specific questions but feel free to suggest recommend anything else regarding the subject What are recommended guides on creating a make file how do I compile from this makefile do I call g myself do I use make Looking at other linux software they almost always seem to have a configure file What exactly does it do Does it only check if the required libraries are installed or does it more than just checking requirements How do I link libraries and how does this relate to my makefile or g parameters In windows I would compile the library include some header files tell my linker what additional lib file to link and copy a dll file How exactly does this process work in linux Recommendations for code editors I am currently using nano and I ve heard of vim and emacs but don t know what the benefits of them are over eachother Are there any others and why would I consider them over any of the previous three Note I am not looking for an IDE Any help links to guides amp documentation preferably those that are aimed at beginners are very much appreciated,cpp
I have a WinForms user control that when added to a form should automatically add some elements to application settings Of course the user should be able to customize disable this behavior is that advisable What is the good way to do this edit The control provides a default implementation for the file menu the consumer only needs to wire up the menu toolbar items in the designer and implement some basic events Part of this is a recent file list which by default should be remembered I agree that the consumer needs full control whether or not he wants these settings added automatically So far I expose the file list as a public string property and the consumer can add the code to init and store this from in the application config If possible I d like to simplify this further so the consumer just provides the settings variable where he wants the setting to be stored if he wants that at all,csharp

wx and wxPython has two events I miss in PyQt EVT_IDLE that s being sent to a frame It can be used to update the various widgets according to the application s state EVT_UPDATE_UI that s being sent to a widget when it has to be repainted and updated so I can compute its state in the handler Now PyQt doesn t seem to have these and the PyQt book suggests writing an updateUi method and calling it manually I even ended up calling it from a timer once per 0 1 seconds in order to avoid many manual calls from methods that may update the GUI Am I missing something Is there a better way to achieve this An example I have a simple app with a Start button that initiates some processing The start button should be enabled only when a file has been opened using the menu In addition there s a permanent widget on the status bar that displays information My application has states Before the file is opened in this state the status bar show something special and the start button is disabled File was opened and processing wasn t started the start button is enabled status bar shows something else The processing is running the start button now says Stop and the status bar reports progress In Wx I d have the update UI event of the button handle its state the text on it and whether it s enabled depending on the application state The same for the status bar or I d use EVT_IDLE for that In Qt I have to update the button in several methods that may affect the state or just create a update_ui method and call it periodically in a timer What is the more QT ish way,python

Working with XHTML 1 1 I have this login page managed in php It contains several checkboxes radiobuttons and a dropdownlist There s a lot of formchecking behind it and if something doesn t check out the page reloads and all values are filled back into their place except for passwords This means the lt select gt lt input type radio and lt input type checkbox elements that have been selected are re selected Yet when I look at the source code the checked checked and selected selected pieces are missing But seeing as how the reloaded page has them selected they must have been implemented Yet when I click my lt input type reset button nothing happens The don t get de selected Fun thing is when I select some other checkboxes radiobuttons and change the select the reset does work but only on the newly clicked checkboxes and radiobuttons Even more weird is the fact that when I click reset the radiobuttons checkboxes and selects don t clear themselves they jump back to the one that was checked or selected when PHP forced the page to reload What s going on here Using firefox by the way checking IE now EDIT IE same problem,php

I ve got a method which currently takes an IList as a parameter where UserBO is similar to the following public class UserBO public string Username get set public string Password get set public string Pin get set public class SomeClass An example method giving the basic idea of what I need to do public void WriteUsers IList lt UserBO gt users Do stuff with users for var user in users Console WriteLine String Format User 0 1 users Username Hash users Pin Now needs to optionally be users Password private string Hash string pin return Hashed Pin This method then uses the Username Pin pairs to create some XML used by another program we ll use the above method as an example The thing is now I need to be able to produce the same code except using the Password field instead of the Pin field there s a good reason for having both fields Instead of just creating another method with a similar name I d prefer to refactor the code so as to remove the BO specific code from this class entirely and make it so that the decision about what class members to use are made not in the method itself but the code calling it One option would be to pass an IDictionary and use the Linq ToDictionary method to create a dictionary on the fly in the calling code This would however lose the ordering of the items which would be nice but not essential to keep I could use an IList or something but that would be more difficult to convert the IList into Does anybody have any good suggestions of how to do this P S If anybody has a better idea of how to title this post feel free to have a go at it,csharp

I m just starting to get my mind around this whole Object Oriented thing so bear with me So I saw an example of an object function for Javascript where you assign a new value and that value gets assigned as that property s actual value Example function Meat name color price function newPrice new_price this price new_price this name name this color color this price price this newprice newPrice Fine and dandy Now I have the ability to assign a price by using Bacon price or Bacon newprice Personally this seems like the highest order of semantics since functionally it does the same thing But as an advocate for semantic coding I ll let it slide Here s what I want When I change the value of Bacon price the object should include a function to store the old value in a property called oldprice automatically I played around with this but got nowhere Here s what I ve tried so far function Meat name color price function oldPrice this oldprice this price this name name this color color this oldprice oldPrice this price price function Meat name color price this name name this color color this oldprice this price this price price More or less variations of that I thought that referring to the already assigned value which would be nothing the first time before the new value got assigned would be enough I know that the value or lack thereof is stored somewhere before it gets assigned I just don t know how to refer to it to assign it to the oldvalue property before it gets wiped out Okay maybe the problem is with my eyes or fingers then Because I thought I had tried the suggestions before asking I know I didn t mention them Unless I m really confused this should work function Meat price function setPrice price this oldprice this price this price price this price setPrice bacon new Meat bacon price Expensive document write bacon price lt br gt document write bacon oldprice lt br gt bacon price Cheap document write bacon price lt br gt document write bacon oldprice lt br gt But the output I get is Expensive undefined Cheap undefined All okay until that last one Again I am willing to accept bad eyesight and poor spelling as the root But I can t figure it out,javascript
A call like this requires the server name or url TeamFoundationServerFactory GetServer mytfsserver Likewise I can use the following to get a list of available servers or server names TeamFoundationServer servers RegisteredServers GetServers string serverNames RegisteredServers GetServerNames But how do I get the default server that Team Explorer uses to connect Alternatively if I could get the current workspace I think I could use that to get the correct TeamFoundationServer to connect with However I want to be able to do this before a solution is loaded which means I do not have a file to use for querying what workspace it belongs in,csharp
How to run an operation on a collection in Python and collect the results So if I have a list of 100 numbers and I want to run a function like this for each of them Operation originalElement anotherVar returns new number and collect the result like so result another list How do I do it Maybe using lambdas,python

Lets say I have a text box that I want to fill a whole line I would give it a style like this input wide display block width 100 This causes problems because the width is based on the content of the text box Text boxes have margin borders amp padding by default which makes a 100 width text box larger than its container For example here on the right Is there any way to make a text box fill the width of its container without expanding beyond it Here is some example HTML to show what I mean lt DOCTYPE html PUBLIC W3C DTD XHTML 1 0 Transitional EN http www w3 org TR xhtml1 DTD xhtml1 transitional dtd gt lt html xmlns http www w3 org 1999 xhtml gt lt head gt lt title gt Untitled Page lt title gt lt style type text css gt outer border 1px solid 000 width 320px margin 0px padding 0px inner margin 20px padding 20px background 999 border 1px solid 000 input wide display block margin 0px input normal display block float right lt style gt lt head gt lt body gt lt div id outer gt lt div id inner gt lt input type text class wide gt lt input type text class normal gt lt div style clear both gt lt div gt lt div gt lt div gt lt body gt lt html gt If this is run you can see by looking at the normal text box that the wide text box is sticking out beyond the container The normal text box floats to the actual edge of the container I m trying to make the wide text box fill its container without expanding beyond edge like the normal text box is,html

I am in need of a performance oriented hash function implementation in C for a hash table that I will be coding I looked around already and only found questions asking what s a good hash function in general I ve considered CRC32 but where to find good implementation and a few cryptography algorithms My table though has very specific requirements Here s what the table will be like 100 000 items max 200 000 capacity so the load is 0 5 hashing a 6 character string which is a part of English sentence examples become and he not The number one priority of my hash table is quick search retrieval Quick insertion is not important but it will come along with quick search Deletion is not important and re hashing is not something I ll be looking into To handle collisions I ll be probably using separate chaining as described here I have already looked at this article but would like an opinion of those who have handled such task before,cpp

I have written a class that checks a POP3 account and I d like it to execute on a thread other than the UI thread To do this I ve chosen the asynchronous route In order to get the result from pop3delegate BeginInvoke null null I need to call EndInvoke but doing this in the UI thread blocks rendering the UI unusable I could use the IAsyncResult object and check the IsComplete property but this involves putting in a loop which checks and this in turn locks up the UI What I m looking for is a way to get a percentage complete or some sort of a status from the POP3 class which in turn updates the UI and also allows the UI to be usable to do other tasks I ll also need to call the EndInvoke method at some point in order to catch any exceptions thrown on the worker thread Any suggestions,csharp

Note that I m talking about the client DNS resolver cache This message is not concerned with the Windows DNS Server I have a C program that does a lot of DNS resolutions Because the HTTPWebRequest component won t let me change the Host header I can t create my own internal DNS cache So I have to depend on the Windows DNS cache which doesn t appear amenable to change There s a reasonably good TechNet article about the DNS cache Registry settings in Windows Server 2003 but I haven t been able to prove that setting them does anything All the other pages I found through a Google search either reference that page or paraphrase it sometimes incorrectly Windows ipconfig command has a displaydns switch that will output the contents of the cache To my knowledge that s the only way to determine the size of the DNS cache In my experiments on a 32 bit Windows XP box with 2 GB of memory no matter what I set the DNS cache registry values to I always end up with between 30 and 40 items in the cache even after doing thousands of DNS resolutions On my 64 bit Windows 2008 machine with 16 GB of memory I always get between 270 and 300 items in the cache I m stumped I don t know what the answer is but I figure one of the following is the case It s not possible to change the size of the DNS resolver cache It is possible but the documentation is wrong The documentation is correct as far as it goes but it      s incomplete The documentation is correct and complete but I      m too dumb to make sense of it The documented registry entries actually changed the size of the cache but ipconfig isn      t showing me all the entries that are in the cache Can anybody tell me if it s possible to configure the size of the DNS resolver cache in Windows XP Vista or Server 2008,csharp

I have written a library that exposes references to several related object types All of these objects have their lifetimes managed by the library internally via boost shared_ptr A user of the library would also be able to know by nature of the library the lifetimes of any of the exposed objects So they could store pointers or keep references to these objects It would be reasonable for them to do this and know when those objects are no longer valid But I feel guilty forcing my users to be reasonable Is it acceptable to have a library expose weak_ptr s to its objects Have other libraries done this I have profiled this library s usage in apps and have found it to be too mission critical to expose weak_ptr exclusively Would it be wiser to have matching API functions expose either a reference or a weak_ptr or to make any object capable of exposing a weak_ptr to itself,cpp

Hey I m relative new to both Java EE and Stackowerflow please be kind I have a bunch of devices triggering Java messages to be sent on any state change These devices are typically active for about 30 90 minute intervals Each event message contains a device id in addition to the event details Central in my application is a message driven bean subscribing to those events Every time I get an event I have to hit the database to look up some info about the device It would be absolutely terrific if I could associate a stateful session bean with each active device If this had been a web application I would have used the http session to store a handle or reference to the stateful bean I m I right Is there any way that I can archive this from my message bean,java

Here s what I do selenium click link mylink selenium waitForPageToLoad 60000 do something then navigate to a different page window focus is never changed in between selenium click link mylink selenium waitForPageToLoad 60000 The link mylink does exist the first invocation of click always works But the second click sometimes seems to work sometimes not It looks like the click event is not triggered at all because the page doesn t even start to load Unfortunately this behaviour is underterministic Here s what I already tried Set longer time timeout did not help Wait for an element present after loading one page doesn t work either since the page does not even start to load For now I ended up invoking click twice so selenium click link mylink selenium waitForPageToLoad 60000 do something then navigate to a different page window focus is never changed in between selenium click link mylink selenium click link mylink selenium waitForPageToLoad 60000 That will work but it s not a really nice solution I ve also seen in another forum where someone suggested to write something like a clickAndWaitWithRetry try super click link mylink super waitForPageToLoad 60000 catch SeleniumException e super click link mylink super waitForPageToLoad 60000 But I think that is also not a proper solution Any ideas explanations why the click event is sometimes not triggered,java
I need to automatically generate a PDF file from an exisiting X HTML document The input files reports use a rather simple table based layout so support for really fancy JavaScript CSS stuff is probably not needed As I am used to working in Java a solution that can easily be used in a java project is preferable It only needs to work on windows systems though One way to do it that is feasable but does not produce good quality output at least out of the box is using CSS2XSLFO and Apache FOP to create the PDF files The problem I encountered was that while CSS attributes are converted nicely the table layout is pretty messed up with text flowing out of the table cell I also took a quick look at Jrex a Java API for using the Gecko rendering engine Is there maybe a way to grab the rendered page from the internet explorer rendering engine and send it to a PDF Printer tool automatically I have no experience in OLE programming in windows so I have no clue what s possible and what is not Do you have an idea EDIT The FlyingSaucer iText thing looks very promising I will try to go with that Thanks for all the answers,java

Like some people know C has very useful operator which evaluates and returns expression on the right if expression on the left is null It s very useful for providing default values for example int spaces readSetting spaces 5 If readSetting couldn t find spaces and returns null variable spaces would hold default value of 5 You could do almost the same in JavaScript and Ruby with operator as in var spaces readSetting spaces 5 although you couldn t have 0 as value of spaces in JavaScript in this case and false in both Ruby and JavaScript PHP has or operator and although it doesn t work as in a sense that it doesn t return expression from the right it still could be useful here spaces readSetting spaces or spaces 5 with the note that and 0 are also treated like false in PHP in addition to false 0 and null in most languages The question is should I use the construction from above Does it have side effects apart from treating large class of characters as false And is there better construction that is usually used and recommended by PHP community this task,php

I have a property grid that helps me manage all of the controls on a form These controls are for designer type folks so I m not really worried that much about the user interface until someone selects multiple objects I have a UITypeEditor for the EffectiveDiameter property on these common objects It keeps track of units meters vs feet and does some nice things on the fly However when someone selects two or three common objects EffectiveDiameter is blank even though it evaluates to the same text string For example in most controls Microsoft has the Anchor property that has a text output of Top Right When you pull it down it is an object with a nice UITypeEditor Yet when you select five objects on your form that all have the same Anchor setting you can still see the string Top Right in the property grid lt summary gt The default containing class for all Unit Management Conversion classes lt summary gt Serializable EditorAttribute typeof umConversionTypeEditor typeof UITypeEditor TypeConverter typeof umConversionTypeConverter public class umConversion public class umConversionTypeEditor UITypeEditor Now in my designer class I have private double _effectiveDiameter get set DisplayName Effective Diameter public virtual umConversion EffectiveDiameter get umConversion ret new umConversion _effectiveDiameter ret MeasureInSI _si return ret set _effectiveDiameter value ImperialUnits If I select several of my custom objects all with the same effective diameter how do I get EffectiveDiameter to display in the PropertyGrid like Anchor does Right now that field is always blank,csharp
Yet again I have some questions regarding polygon algorithms I ll try to explain my problem I am using a subset of a third party library called Geometric Tools GT to perform boolean operations on my polygons To accomplish this I have to convert my internal polygon format to the format GT uses Our internal polygon format consists of a vertex array while the GT polygon consists of an indexed vertex array where each edge is represented by a pair of indices Example of a square for clarification Internal format vertices 0 Vertex2D 1 0 gt start vertices 1 Vertex2D 1 1 vertices 2 Vertex2D 0 1 vertices 3 Vertex2D 0 0 vertices 4 Vertex2D 1 0 gt end External format vertices 0 Vertex2D 1 0 vertices 1 Vertex2D 1 1 vertices 2 Vertex2D 0 1 vertices 3 Vertex2D 0 0 edges 0 std pair lt int int gt 0 1 edges 1 std pair lt int int gt 1 2 edges 2 std pair lt int int gt 2 3 edges 3 std pair lt int int gt 3 0 There is also a BSP tree of the polygon which I don t care to depict here Now I wrote an algorithm that works in most cases but crashes and burns when two edges share the same starting vertex Let me start by explaining how my current algorithm works Make a std map where the key is an integer representing the vertex index The value represents where in the edge array there is an edge with the key index as starting index Mockup example std vector lt std pair lt int int gt gt edge_array edge_array push_back std pair lt int int gt 0 1 edge_array push_back std pair lt int int gt 2 3 edge_array push_back std pair lt int int gt 1 2 edge_array push_back std pair lt int int gt 3 0 std map lt int int gt edge_starts for int i 0 i lt edge_array size i edge_starts edge_array i first i To jump from correct edge to correct edge i can now just do the following inside a while loop while current_placed_index first_index_in_polygon int index_to_next_edge_to_be_traversed edge_starts current_edge second Inside this loop there is done some optimization and vertex indices are added to an array Each time a polygon is closed i find the first untraversed edge and start making another polygon I keep on doing this until there are no more untraversed edges in the GTPolygon So each GTPolygon can result in several Polygon internal objects The flaw in this algorithm is evident when there are two edges sharing the same vertex as a starting vertex Example lt 1 2 gt lt 1 3 gt lt 1 5 gt When traversing my edges how will i know which of these edges belongs to the polygon I am currently traversing I could try traversing the edges BACKWARDS when such a duplicate situation occurs The problem then would be the possibility of the traversation going back and forth infinitely if another duplicate is found while reversing My question is how can I solve this Is it solvable at all Can I use the BSP tree to solve this in some way The amount of corner cases is a bit daunting Any help is greatly appreciated as 5 months of work depends on this working Edit To clarify I want to convert from the indexed representation of a polygon that Geometry Tools works with to our internal polygon format which is just a series of connected vertices in a list,cpp

I m using UnixODBC with PHP 5 2 4 on Ubuntu 8 04 LTS and trying to pull all the results from a table sitting on an IBM i and replicate them to a local MySQL table Code wise it is working with no errors but I m ending up with more rows that what is contained on the IBM i I should end up with 25 613 rows but PHP reports that 25 630 rows are being inserted into the MySQL database counter 0 while row odbc_fetch_array result Insert into MySQL using Zend Framework counter echo counter When I look in the MySQL database some of the rows are actually duplicated I saw a note on the odbc_fetch_array documentation about erratic behavior when accessing the IBM i but trying that solution causes the script to run and run without ever seeming to finish Any ideas on what to check,php

In his article about preventing multiple instances of an application Michael Covington presents this code static void Main args are OK here of course bool ok m new System Threading Mutex true YourNameHere out ok if ok MessageBox Show Another instance is already running return Application Run new Form1 or whatever was there GC KeepAlive m important He explains that the GC KeepAlive m is required to prevent the garbage collector from collecting the mutex early since there are no additional references to it My question will wrapping the mutex in a using do the same thing That is will the following also prevent the GC from pulling the rug out from under me static void Main args are OK here of course bool ok using var m new System Threading Mutex true YourNameHere out ok if ok MessageBox Show Another instance is already running return Application Run new Form1 or whatever was there My gut reaction is that the using will work since using is supposed to be equivalent to Mutex m new System Threading Mutex true YourNameHere out ok try do stuff here finally m Close And I would think that the m Close there would be enough to signal to the JIT compiler that there s another reference thus preventing premature garbage collection,csharp

I am maintaining an application that has classes written in 2005 that extend javax xml messaging JAXMServlet While upgrading to a new app server that implements the latest J2EE standards I discovered that JAXMServlet was removed in JWSDP 2 0 Java Web Services Developer Pack according to this question and apparently JWSDP itself has been deprecated too The code it relies on has not significantly changed since it was written and is part of a large ish existing production system where this code is already tested and debugged so I am reluctant to rewrite the classes from scratch due to the regression testing impact Is there an easy substitution for this class Although Google has a lot of examples of using this code dated from around 2003 2004 it is surprisingly mute about replacing it Thanks,java
I have a simple page with a single rendered iFrame There s a link called Add File and unobtrusively I would like to attach an event to the Add File anchor so that when clicked it inserts a new iFrame below the existing one with the ID of the iFrame incremented An example of the iFrame would be lt iframe name uploadForm1 id uploadForm1 src lt upload_file_url gt height 50 width 800 frameborder 0 scrolling no gt lt iframe gt Then when clicking the Add File button I would end up with lt iframe name uploadForm1 id uploadForm1 src lt upload_file_url gt height 50 width 800 frameborder 0 scrolling no gt lt iframe gt lt iframe name uploadForm2 id uploadForm2 src lt upload_file_url gt height 50 width 800 frameborder 0 scrolling no gt lt iframe gt What would be the best approach jQuery or Prototype to accompish this It seems very trivial however because of the fact that I need to render the upload_file_url route I m not too sure how to approach it without wasting a whole lot of time Any assistance is appreciated,javascript

Is it possible to have objects stored in a data structure for the duration of an App Server s uptime Basically I want an EJB that interfaces with this Data Structure but does not require a full fledged database solution As an example I made this dummy animal object package com test entities public class Animal implements java io Serializable private static final long serialVersionUID 3621626745694501710L private Integer id private String animalName public Integer getId TODO Auto generated method stub return id public void setId Integer id this id id public String getAnimalName return animalName public void setAnimalName String animalName this animalName animalName So here is the EJB Remote Interface package com test beans import java util Map import javax ejb Remote import com test entities Animal Remote public interface MapBeanRemote public void addAnimal Animal a public void removaAnimal Integer id public Animal getAnimalById Integer id Map lt Integer Animal gt getAllAnimals Here is the Session Bean package com test beans import java util ConcurrentHashMap import java util Map import javax annotation PostConstruct import javax ejb Stateless import com test entities Animal Stateless mappedName ejb MapBean public class MapBean implements MapBeanRemote Map lt Integer Animal gt animalStore PostConstruct public void initialize animalStore new ConcurrentHashMap lt Integer Animal gt Override public void addAnimal Animal a if a getId null animalStore put a getId a Override public Animal getAnimalById Integer id return animalStore get id Override public void removaAnimal Integer id animalStore remove id Override public Map lt Integer Animal gt getAllAnimals return animalStore So basically I want any client who wants to manipulate the Animal Map to go through this EJB and have each client accessing the same exact Map of objects This example does not work good enough After a while all of the animals are erased I m assuming when the EJB gets replaced from the bean pool Could this somehow be injected as a resource,java

I m probably asking this question wrong and that may be why Google isn t helping but here goes In Visual Studio I am compiling a C project let s call it Project A the startup project which has a reference to Project B Project B has a reference to a Project C so when A gets built the dlls for B gets placed in the bin directory of A as does the dll for C because B requires C and A requires B However I have apparently made some change recently so that the dll for Project C does not go into the bin directory of Project A when rebuilding the solution I have no idea what I ve done to make this happen I have not modified the setup of the solution itself and I have only added additional references to the project files Code wise I have commented out most of the actual code in Project B that references classes in Project C but did not remove the reference from the project itself I don t think this matters I was told that perhaps the C compiler was optimizing somehow so that it was not building Project C but really I m out of ideas I would think someone has run into something similar before Any thoughts Thanks,csharp

I m trying to rename a file after it s uploaded in the model s save method I m renaming the file to a combination the files primary key and a slug of the file title I have it working when a file is first uploaded when a new file is uploaded and when there are no changes to the file or file title However when the title of the file is changed and the system tries to rename the old file to the new path I get the following error WindowsError at admin main file 1 32 The process cannot access the file because it is being used by another process I don t really know how to get around this I ve tried just coping the file to the new path This works but I don t know I can delete the old version Shortened Model class File models Model nzb models FileField upload_to files name models CharField max_length 256 name_slug models CharField max_length 256 blank True null True editable False def save self Create the name slug self name_slug re sub a zA Z0 9 self name strip lower self name_slug re sub self name_slug Need the primary key for naming the file super File self save Create the system paths we need orignal_nzb u 1 s 2 s 1 settings MEDIA_ROOT 2 self nzb renamed_nzb u 1 sfiles 2 s_ 3 s nzb 1 settings MEDIA_ROOT 2 self pk 3 self name_slug Rename the file if orignal_nzb not in renamed_nzb if os path isfile renamed_nzb os remove renamed_nzb Fails when name is updated os rename orignal_nzb renamed_nzb self nzb files 1 s_ 2 s nzb 1 self pk 2 self name_slug super File self save I suppose the question is does anyone know how I can rename an uploaded file when the uploaded file isn t be re uploaded That s the only time it appears to be locked in use Update Tyler s approach is working except when a new file is uploaded the primary key is not available and his technique below is throwing an error if not instance pk instance save Error maximum recursion depth exceeded while calling a Python object Is there any way to grab the primary key,python

My team need the Sobol quasi random number generator a common RNG which is famous for good quality results and speed of operation I found what looks like a simple C implementation on the web At home I was able to compile it almost instantaneously using my Linux GCC compiler The following day I tried it at work If I compile in Visual Studio in debug mode it takes about 1 minute If I were to compile it in release mode it takes about 40 minutes Why I know that release mode triggers some compiler optimization but how on earth could a file this small take so long to optimize It s mostly comments and static data There s hardly anything worth optimizing None of these PCs are particularly slow and in any case I know that the compile time is consistent across a range of Windows computers I ve also heard that newer versions of Visual Studio have a faster compile time however for now we are stuck with Visual Studio Net 2003 Compiling on GCC the one bundled with Ubuntu 8 04 always takes microseconds,cpp

I recently asked this question http stackoverflow com questions 638463 Marc Gravell answer was perfect and it solved my problem But it gave me something to think about If and Extension method must be placed on a Static Class and the method itself must be static why can t we create a static Extension method I understand that the parameter marked as this will be used to allow access to an instance of the object we are extending What I do not understand is why can t a method be created to be static it just seems to me that this is a senseless limitation My question is Why can t we create an extension method that will work as a static Method,csharp

We have a situation where we want to define a relationship where a class named Module may or may not be related to a Module object that is a predecessor to it There can be zero or none predecessors The class looks like this public class Module public int Id get set other stuff here public Module Predecessor get set And we have defined our mapping so that Predecessor is a property of type Module like so lt class name Module gt lt Id name Id gt lt generator class native gt lt Id lt property name Predecessor type Module unique true gt lt class gt However we are getting complaints about the mapping not being able to compile because it cannot find the type Module We have tried the long name for the class type STC EI JobSubmissionSystem Data Domain and the fully qualified name for the class type STC EI JobSubmissionSystem Data Domain STC EI JobSubmissionSystem Data to no avail My question is Are we mapping this properly and if not then how do we map it properly,csharp

I m using Linq to SQL for a fairly complicated site and after go live we ve had a number of database timeouts The first thing I noticed was there are a fairly large number of connections to the database Coming from an ADO net background we used to code it so that any site would only use one or two pooled connections and this resulted in acceptable performance even with a fair few concurrent users So my question is was this old way of doing it flawed OR is there a way to do it LINQ It seems our performance issues are being caused by so many connections to the DB but if this was an issue I d have thought it would be mentioned in all the tutorials for LINQ Any suggestions,csharp
It is true what they say about design patterns that they are simply the embodiment of techniques already in general use I have been using the Active Record Pattern since 1985 One of the attributes of this pattern is the use of static members in the implementation to perform searches that return collections of the underlying data class Customer static Customer FindCustomerById int Id static Customer FindActiveCustomers In many cases where I need much more flexibility I break encapsulation and include a method such as static Customer FindCustomers string criteria where one would call it as Customer customers Customer FindCustomers LastName Smith Of course this is a hold over from when I used this pattern in C is clearly not a best practice and in the wrong hands can lead to SQL injection and other problems Is there a suitable pattern or practice that could be applied that would allow the Customer class to become a criteria for such a search For example suppose I want to find customers whose last name was Smith I might consider writing an implementation such as static Customer FindCustomers Customer customer to be called as with the appropriate constructor of course Customer customersnamedsmith Customer FindCustomer new Customer Smith Or is it better to create a co class that would define the criteria,csharp

We want to generate Reports either embedded as html pages in a web app or downloadable as a pdf Hence I came across JasperReports because it thought it would fullfill these requirements Currently we assume our report will have about 50 100 pages consisting of nearly only histograms and some tables The data is retrieved by some expensive queries from our DB After evaluating it the whole day i have several doubts regarding web app aspects 1 Pagination Of course I don t want to display all pages in a single web page We need something like pagination But JasperReports seems not to support this approach The wepp demo which comes with JasperReports sketches the way to go I have to create a JasperPrint which is already the full report allocating unrequired memory and which has performed the expensive queries Then I could display a single page But doing this again and again for each page does not appear as a proper solution to me 2 As mentioned above our report will mostly consist of diagrams Images are generated during Exporting the JasperPrint to its output format If I understand everything correct the ImageServlet which comes with JR is capable but retrieve these images be i Reading the generated images from the file system ii the exporter has stored them in the session therefore in memory Since I think we will have a lot of images ii is not an option if we want to keep the memory footprint of the webapp low But on the other hand flooding the file system with files is also not the best idea i could imagine Does it delete the files somewhen Did I got something wrong Is my understanding Correct,java
What s the correct semantic way to specify image height and width In CSS width 15px or inline lt img width 15 CSS seems like the right place to put visual information On the other hand few would argue that image src should not be specified as an attribute and the height width seem as tied to the binary image data as the src is Yes I realize from a technical end user perspective this really doesn t matter,html

I recently had my mind expanded by a new concept Web Services for Remote Portlets or WSRP I learned of it during a presentation on a Java based web portal we are considering purchasing at work we are a NET shop and WSRP would be the means by which we would extend this portal Although I cannot control the end decision as to whether or not we purchase the product I can provide input as to how difficult it would be to build WSRP compliant portlets Unfortunately my recent queries into the subject have turned up almost nill So I ask you the SO community the following what libraries or frameworks are out there for building WSRP compliant portlets in C NET What are some of the pros and cons of using WSRP in general Because there is no correct answer here I will make this a community wiki post So far I have only found the following WSRP Toolkit for Sharepoint by Microsoft but requiring Sharepoint WSRP Portal and WSRP NET Framework By NetUnity Given that WSRP is on top of SOAP this seems like a perfect candidate for a WCF binding and channel and yet I see nothing on the subject anywhere,csharp

When parsing an xml document for its nodes or attributes if the document is large I would have a bunch of ifs and else statements Obviously 100 ifs does not make up maintainable code in the long run Rather than doing this is there another better way I read on Hanselman s blog about a friend of his who had the same situation and wrote loads of ifs else if and generally poor code Hanselman provided some snippets of a more maintainable way but the entire code isn t available so it s a little hard to understand exactly what the whole picture is going on Life after if else I am using NET 3 5 SO I have the full power of extension methods and LINQ available to me However I use NET 2 0 a work so would also appreciate any solutions in v2 0 My code looks very similar to the problem on Hanselman s site if xmlNode Attributes a Value abc else if xmlNode Attributes b Value xyz wt MyEnum Haze I could just have a dictionary storing the values I am looking for as keys and perhaps a delegate in the value or whatever I want to happen on finding a required value so I could say if containskey get delegate and execute it in pseudocode This sort of thing goes on and on Obviously very naive way of coding I have the same problem with parsing a text document for values etc Thanks,csharp

When ASP NET controls are rendered their ids sometimes change like if they are in a naming container Button1 may actually have an id of ctl00_ContentMain_Button1 when it is rendered for example I know that you can write your JavaScript as strings in your cs file get the control s clientID and inject the script into your page using clientscript but is there a way that you can reference a control directly from JavaScript using ASP NET Ajax I have found that writing a function to parse the dom recursively and find a control that CONTAINS the id that I want is unreliable so I was looking for a best practice rather than a work around,javascript
Right now I have a central module in a framework that spawns multiple processes using the Python 2 6 multiprocessing module Because it uses multiprocessing there is module level multiprocessing aware log LOG multiprocessing get_logger Per the docs this logger has process shared locks so that you don t garble things up in sys stderr or whatever filehandle by having multiple processes writing to it simultaneously The issue I have now is that the other modules in the framework are not multiprocessing aware The way I see it I need to make all dependencies on this central module use multiprocessing aware logging That s annoying within the framework let alone for all clients of the framework Are there alternatives I m not thinking of,python

I came across an interesting problem today I have a text email I m sending from a Web page I m displaying a preview and wanted to put the preview in a fixed font retaining the white space since that s the way the plain text email will appear Basically I want something that ll act like Notepad the newlines will signal a newline but the text will otherwise wrap to fit inside it s container Unfortunately this is proving difficult unless I m missing something really obvious I ve tried CSS white space pre This retains white space but doesn t wrap lines of text so they go out the borders on long lines Styling a textarea element to be read only with no border so it basically apepars like a div The problem here is that IE doesn t like 100 heights on textareas in strict mode Bizarrely it s OK with them in quirks mode but that s not an option for me CSS white space prewrap This is CSS 2 1 so probably not widely supported I m happy if it s supported in IE7 and FF3 though I don t care about IE6 for this as its an admin function and no one will be running IE6 that will use this page Any other suggestions Can this really be that hard edit can t comment so more info Yes at the moment I am using font Courier New i e fixed width and using a regex on the server side to replace the newlines with lt br gt tags but now I need to edit the content and it just strikes me as awkward that you need to strip out and add the lt br gt s to make it work is there no better way,html

Is there any benefit to explicitly using the StoredProcedure CommandType as opposed to just using a Text Command In other words is cmd new SqlCommand EXEC StoredProc p1 p2 cmd CommandType CommandType Text cmd Parameters Add p1 1 cmd Parameters Add p2 2 any worse than cmd new SqlCommand StoredProc cmd CommandType CommandType StoredProcedure cmd Parameters Add p1 1 cmd Parameters Add p2 2 EDIT Fixed bad copy paste job again Also the whole point of the question is for a data access class I d much rather be able to pass the stored proc name and parameters in one line as opposed to extra lines for each parameter,csharp

I ve read Joel s article on Unicode and I feel that I have at least a basic grasp of internationalization from a character set perspective In addition to reading this question I ve also done some of my own research on internationalization in regards to design considerations but I can t help but suspect that there is a lot more out there that I just don t know or don t know to ask Some of the things I ve learned Some languages read right to left instead of left to right Calendar dates times currency and numbers are displayed differently from language to language Design should be flexible enough to accommodate a lot more text because some languages are far more verbose than others Don t take icons or colors for granted when it comes to their semantic meaning as this can vary from culture to culture Geographical nomenclature varies from language to language Where I m at My design is flexible enough to accommodate a lot more text I automatically translate each string including error messages and help dialogs I haven t come to a point yet where I ve needed to display units of time currency or numbers but I ll be there shortly and will need to develop a solution I m using the UTF 8 character set across the board My menus and various lists in the application are sorted alphabetically for each language for easier reading I have a tag parser that extracts tags by filtering out stop words The stop words list is language specific and can be swapped out What I d like to know more about I m developing a downloadable PHP web application so any specific advice in regards to PHP would be greatly appreciated I ve developed my own framework and am not interested in using other frameworks at this time I know very little about non western languages Are there specific considerations that need to be taken into account that I haven t mentioned above Also how do PHP s array sorting functions handle non western characters Are there any specific gotchas that you ve experienced in practice I m looking in terms of both the GUI and the application code itself Any specific advice for working with date and time displays Is there a breakdown according to region or language I ve seen a lot of projects and sites let their communities provide translation for their applications and content Do you recommend this and what are some good strategies for ensuring that you have a good translation This question is basically the extent of what I know about internationalization What don t I know that I don t know that I should look into further Edit I added the bounty because I would like to have more real world examples from experience,php

I have an app that was compiled with the built in Eclipse Compile task Then I decided to move the build procedure into Ant s javac and the result ended being smaller files Later I discovered that adjusting the debuglevel to vars lines source I could embed the same debug information that Eclipse did and in a lot of cases files stayed exactly the same size but the internal layout was different And as a consequence I couldn t use md5sum signatures to determine if they were exactly the same version Besides debug information what can be the reason that 2 supposedly equal files get a different internal layout or size And how can you compare compiled class files,java

Modern computers have more and more cores We want to change our current linear algorithm to use these cores A splitting of any algorithm to use different threads only makes sense if there is a free processor Are there any good libraries that can help to parallelize some steps if there are free processors I will give some examples If there is only one processor it makes no sense to create multiple threads It will reduce the speed If there run 2 processes requests on a server on a core duo it make also no sense to start threads If there only one process on a core duo it make sense The abstract algorithm has 4 steps A B C and D Steps A B and C can execute parallel Step D needs the results from A B and C Edit I means an mathematic algorithm No IO No events etc,java

I have an object which does some computation then for each iteraction I want to draw what happens While the drawing is happening I want it to wait This is what I did basically synchronized public void compute other mark variable try wait catch InterruptedException e in the OtherClass I have synchronized public void mark int var change some stuff repaint notify What happens is that compute waits forever I thought this was going to work since no erros were given by the compiler Neither class implements Runnable or extends Thread so maybe that s the problem I m not sure since I figure I d be warned if these objects couldn t use such methods I m thinking it might be an error regarding the logic of the program itself but in a nutshell that s what I have,java

I m getting System IO FileNotFoundException The specified module could not be found when running C code that calls a C CLI assembly which in turn calls a pure C DLL It happens as soon as an object is instantiated that calls the pure C DLL functions BackingStore is pure C CPPDemoViewModel is C CLI calling BackingStore it has a reference to BackingStore I tried the simplest possible case add a new C unit test project that just tries to create an object defined in CPPDemoViewModel I added a reference from the C project to CPPDemoViewModel A C CLI test project works fine with just the added ref to CPPDemoViewModel so it s something about going between the languages I m using Visual Studio 2008 SP1 with Net 3 5 SP1 I m building on Vista x64 but have been careful to make sure my Platform target is set to x86 This feels like something stupid and obvious I m missing but it would be even more stupid of me to waste time trying to solve it in private so I m out here embarrassing myself This is a test for a project porting a huge amount of legacy C code which I m keeping in a DLL with a ViewModel implemented in C CLI edit After checking directories I can confirm that the BackingStore dll has not been copied I have the standard unique project folders created with a typical multi project solution WPFViewModelInCPP BackingStore CPPViewModel CPPViewModelTestInCS bin Debug Debug The higher level Debug appears to be a common folder used by the C and C CLI projects to my surprise WPFViewModelInCPP Debug contains BackingStore dll CPPDemoViewModel dll CPPViewModelTest dll and their associated ilk and pdb files WPFViewModelInCPP CPPViewModelTestInCS bin Debug contains CPPDemoViewModel and CPPViewModelTestInCS dll and pdb files but not BackingStore However manually copying BackingStore into that directory did not fix the error CPPDemoViewModel has the property Copy Local set which I assume is responsible for copying its DLL when if is referenced I can t add a reference from a C project to a pure C DLL it just says A Reference to Backing Store could not be added I m not sure if I have just one problem or two I can use an old fashioned copying build step to copy the BackingStore dll into any given C project s directories although I d hoped the new net model didn t require that DependencyWalker is telling me that the missing file is GPSVC dll which has been suggested indicates security setting issues I suspect this is a red herring edit2 With a manual copy of BackingStore dll to be adjacent to the executable the GUI now works fine The C Test Project still has problems which I suspect is due to the runtime environment of a test project but I can live without that for now,csharp
I feel that while I love J2ME and Java it s hypocritical of them to have two APIs for Java Java was designed with One code many platforms in mind and now it s more like One API for every OS and one API for everything smaller than a netbook I see a lot of J2ME emulators and such being ported to things like the PSP and other consoles for homebrew and I wonder why no one is doing this with normal Java I d love to write a game to play on my PC than fire up a simple emulator and play the same game on the PSP or the Dreamcast but I can t J2ME can t even run on a PC you need an emulator for it which reduces your market greatly Plus most emulators are bulky and not good With super phones like the IPhone coming out people are going to want more than little J2ME games so if Java can t port their standard JRE to it they might find themselves missing the boat like Microsoft did with the netbook boom It just feels like Sun needs to ether work on making the standard JRE smaller and more portable or making J2ME available on the PC easily,java

I ve been comparing a STL implementation of a popular XmlRpc library with an implementation that mostly avoids STL The STL implementation is much slower I got 47s down to 4 5s I ve diagnosed some of the reasons it s partly due to std string being mis used e g the author should have used const std string amp wherever possible don t just use std string s as if they were Java strings but it s also because copy constructors were being constantly called each time the vector outgrew its bounds which was exceedingly often The copy constructors were very slow because they did deep copies of trees of XmlRpc values I was told by someone else on StackOverflow that std vector implementations typically double the size of the buffer each time they outgrow This does not seem to be the case on VisualStudio 2008 to add 50 items to a std vector took 177 calls of the copy constructor Doubling each time should call the copy constructor 64 times If you were very concerned about keeping memory usage low then increasing by 50 each time should call the copy constructor 121 times So where does the 177 come from My question is a why is the copy constructor called so often b is there any way to avoid using the copy constructor if you re just moving an object from one location to another In this case and indeed most cases a memcpy would have sufficed and this makes a BIG difference NB I know about vector reserve I m just a bit disappointed that application programmers would need to implement the doubling trick when something like this is already part of any good STL implementation My test program include lt string gt include lt iostream gt include lt vector gt using namespace std int constructorCalls int assignmentCalls int copyCalls class C int n public C int _n n _n constructorCalls C const C amp orig copyCalls n orig n void operator const C amp orig assignmentCalls n orig n int main int argc char argv std vector lt C gt A A reserve 50 for int i 0 i lt 50 i A push_back i cout lt lt constructor calls lt lt constructorCalls lt lt n cout lt lt assignment calls lt lt assignmentCalls lt lt n cout lt lt copy calls lt lt copyCalls lt lt n return 0,cpp

When working with Sockets in Java how can you tell whether the client has finished sending all binary data before you could start processing them Consider for example istream new BufferedInputStream socket getInputStream ostream new BufferedOutputStream socket getOutputStream byte buffer new byte BUFFER_SIZE int count while istream available gt 0 amp amp count istream read buffer 1 do something assuming all input has been read ostream write getResponse ostream flush I ve read similar posts on SO such as this but couldn t find a conclusive answer While my solution above works my understanding is that you can never really tell if the client has finished sending all data If for instance the client socket sends a few chunks of data and then blocks waiting for data from another data source before it could send more data the code above may very well assume that the client has finished sending all data since istream available will return 0 for the current stream of bytes,java

I have a priority_queue of some object typedef priority_queue lt Object gt Queue Queue queue From time to time the priority of one of the objects may change I need to be able to update the priority of that object in the queue in an efficient way Currently I am using this method which works but seems inefficient Queue newQueue while queue empty Object obj queue top queue pop if priorityHasChanged obj newQueue push_back Object new_priority else newQueue push_back obj newQueue swap queue this only works because I actually subclassed the priority_queue class and exposed a swap method that swaps in the container I implemented it this way because I was in kind of a hurry at the time and this was the quickest thing I could do that I could be sure it would work ok There has to be a better way than this though Really what I want is a way to either extract out the instance with the changed priority and insert a new one with the new priority value update the instance with the changed priority and then update the queue so that it is correctly sorted What is the best way to do this,cpp

In my master page I have a language dropdown menu When the user selects a language from the dropdown a submit sends the currently selected language to the Translate method in my controller After which it should redirect to the url it was before the translation submit so it can show the exact same page but now in the newly selected language How would I best go about this Should I send the current url somehow in a hidden field Or can I maybe send the current routevaluedictionary so my translate method can redirectToRoute directly Or maybe there is an entirely better way EDIT Because I want my bookmarks to include the site language too all my exposed actions have a siteLanguage parameter too If I could somehow efficiently show the user a bunch of regular GET links where the siteLanguage parameter is filled in with the relevant value that would be even better But as far as I know there is no way to put links in a dropdown except with java maybe,csharp

On my site I have a simple login form The page is served via HTTP but the form s POST URL is HTTPS The normal method is that the user fills in their username password the form is submitted to the fully qualified HTTPS URL on the same site and then the POST processing does a 303 redirect to the users homepage But sometimes this doesn t happen The cycle and this is 100 repeatable is this Visit login form fill in details and submit On the server the login script gets called validates the data and then if all is well does a 303 redirect to the users home page I then click logout and then click login at which point I m taken back to the login form I then fill in my details again hit submit This time however the login logic doesn t execute the debug code that logged the login at step 2 doesn t get called and yet I m still redirected to the users homepage But because I ve not been logged in successfully I get kicked out to the front page So why isn t the POST always calling the login form I don t think the 303 is being cached and it shouldn t be according to the spec Looking at the HTTPS logs in the server login phpo is being called the first time but not the second Edit OK we ve solved the problem For those that are interested The site is run on 2 webservers behind a load balancer user sessions are sticky that is to say once a user is browsing on one web server the LB will keep them attached to that server This is done via a cookie But once we switch to HTTPS the LB can t read the cookie as the connection is encrypted between the browser and web server So it was alternating between servers WWe have code to propagate login authentications between webservers but this wasn t happening fast enough So what was happening was User browsers to server A gets a cookie saying keep me on A fills in their login credentials and hits submit The LB being unable to decipher the HTTPS traffic and thus the cookie sends them 50 of the time to B B validates the login and sets the user to be authenticated in the session before redirecting the user to the non https homepage Because the homepage is non https the LB reads the cookie and sends them to A which knows nothing of the authentication since it wasn t propagating fast enough from B The solution was to allow the LB to decrypt HTTPS traffic thus ensuring that users really do stay on one web server regardless of HTTP HTTPS transitions,php

I had an idea and I wanted to run it by you to get some feedback Please look the following over and let me know what you think whether it s positive or negative I ve always wished that there was a way to embed certain pieces of data in Java code without having to follow Java s rules all the time I ve heard a lot of talk about Domain Specific Languages lately DSLs and how it would be great if we could utilize them more on a daily basis I think I have an idea of how to do this in a reasonably elegant way Here are some examples of things that I know of that are a pain to represent in Java code and other C like languages that I want this to solve List of short strings as string array String ar Item1 Item2 Item3 Item4 List of long strings as string array String ar The quick brown n fox jumped over n the lazy dog The quick brown n fox jumped over n the lazy dog The quick brown n fox jumped over n the lazy dog The quick brown n fox jumped over n the lazy dog Table of strings as multi

with decent text formatting String html Hi John r n lt br gt r n lt br gt Thank you for writing to us We do not currently carry that specific product r n lt br gt r n lt br gt Regards r n lt br gt I ve investigated the following described solution a bit and I believe it s possible to create a usable library that would allow you to achieve this elegantly In Java 5 and 6 there is something called the Annotation Processor Tool APT not the same as Debian APT You create your own source code processor which will be called as the code is being compiled to give you the opportunity to rewrite the source code After rewriting the code it is compiled as usual The following must be done to make use of APT 1 Put this library s jar on the ANT classpath 2 Put this library s jar on the project classpath 3 Call the apt task instead of javac and add the preprocessdir parameter to specify where the generated files must be placed The DSL code can be placed inside a comment right after the variable where the result of the code will be placed When the processor runs it can look forward in the code for the next comment extract the code run it through the processor generate the code and do the compile Here is the list again this time with what it could look like List of short strings as string array DslTextArray String ar null Item1 Item2 Item3 Item4 List of long strings as string array DslMultilineTextArray String ar null The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog The quick brown fox jumped

null lt a href www somesite com gt Some site lt a gt HTML text block with decent text formatting DslText String html null Hi John Thank you for writing to us We do not currently carry that specific product Regards Mike Some requirements features I can think of for this solution You must declare the variable to hold the data that the script will generate in the Java source code This allows the rest of the source code to know about the resulting data even though the compiler doesn t know where it s coming from Must not violate the Java language so that the IDE and javac do not show errors Work with all the existing Java code you have No need to replace any existing code Just add these snippets wherever you like Must be easily extensible with additional types Must be able to later make extensions to IDE s that allow for source code highlighting and auto completion Translations occur at compile time so valid Java code must be generated Convert to String and String for things like lists multi line text blocks such as CSS SQL Convert and encode XML HTML When code is rewritten retain the same line numbers Do not add any lines so that debugging and reading errors does not become a pain Run code written in any BSF language at runtime Allow it to pass any parameter to the script and return any Java class or primitive back to Java Run code written in any BSF language at compile time to generate Java source code Similar to how M4 is used on Linux Later Allow you to chain together the String results from many calls to build a long string Some if it may be compile time some of it run time Again I would really appreciate getting some feedback on this Is this a stupid idea Is there something like this out there already Would you bother using something like this or should I just keep it to myself,java
Is this guaranteed to be always true std numeric_limits lt int gt max INT_MAX What does C standard say about it I could not find any reference in the standard that would explicitly state this but I keep reading that those should be equivalent What about C99 types that are not in C 98 standard for compilers that implement both C99 at least long long part and C 98 I am not sure whether there is any guarantee that this always holds true std numeric_limits lt unsigned long long gt max ULLONG_MAX Is this a reasonable assumption,cpp
i have a POST request firstname 1 amp lastname 10 amp firstname 2 amp lastname 20 amp firstname 3 amp lastname 30 then i get comma delimited lists of names and values Request Form firstname 1 2 3 Request Form lastname 10 20 30 it seems that NameValueCollection does not contain a method to access specified firstname value directly the task looks standard like Request Form index property in ASP of course i can implement a custom helper enumerator or simply parse strings someway but i m not sure there are no any standard solution to be honest i would prefer to have direct access to each firstname lastname pair but i cannot ask impossible,csharp

I found this piece of code inside System Web ISAPIRuntime using Reflector public void DoGCCollect for int i 10 i gt 0 i GC Collect Can anyone comment on this Is there a reason to do GC Collect in a loop Why 10 times and not 3 5 or 20 Analysis indicated that it s not used inside net framework but it s public so I suppose that IIS could call it edit Just for clarification purposes I have never called GC Collect and I have no intentions of using it I know it s a bad idea in most if not all cases The question is why net framework does it Thanks for all your answers,csharp
Is there a site that provides a great list of common C optimization practices What I mean by optimization is that you have to modify the source code to be able to run a program faster not changing the compiler settings,cpp

Is using h as a header for a c file wrong I see it all over the place especially with code written in the C style I noticed that Emacs always selects C highlighting style for a h header but c for hpp or hh Is it actually wrong to label your headers h or is it just something which annoys me EDIT There is a good ish reason why this annoys me if I have project files labelled hpp amp cpp I can get away with grep something pp etc otherwise I have to type h cpp,cpp
I m a bit stumped I have to integrate an existing simple asp net web forms app including postbacks etc into another external site with a jquery load call an app that was intended to be integrated through an iframe I doubt that s possible without a rewrite of the app The app is a basic questionnaire that leads the user to a product suggestion at the end Does anyone have any pointers to how I could solve this I guess I will probably have to rewrite the app with web services and dynamic calls to RenderUserControls I will also need access to the page that calls the load and write additional jQuery methods to handle the user input I will probably have to remove all of asp net s postback calls and rewrite the handling of the user input Any pointers or helping ideas I wish I could already shell out a bounty for this because it is rather urgent,jquery
On my website I use PHP sessions Session information is stored in files in my session path After a few months I discovered that these session files are never deleted by now there are 145 000 of them in this directory How should these be cleaned up Do I have to do it programmatically or is ther a setting I can use somewhere that would have this cleanup happen automatically EDIT forgot to mention This site runs at a provider so I don t have access to a command line I do have ftp access but the session files belong to another user the one the webserver proces runs I guess From the first answers I got I think it s not just a setting on the server or PHP so I guess I ll have to implement something for it in PHP and call that periodically from a browser maybe from a cron job running on my own machine at home,php
I m trying to create a DataGridView cell class which hosts a control all the time not just while editing So far my approach has been to add the control to the grid and try to synchronise its position with that of the cell Would it be possible instead to keep the cell offscreen route mouse and keyboard events to it and paint it onto the cell UPDATE By offscreen I don t mean that it should be added to another control such that it isn t displayed I mean that it should never be added to another control at all,csharp
I have the following problem basically i have a WCF service which operates fine in small tests However when i attempt a batch load test i get an InvalidOperationException with the message when the open method is called on the proxy class The communication object System ServiceModel Channels ServiceChannel cannot be modified while it is in the Opened state I have searched google but cannot find anyone else really quoting this exception message I guess some further info on the service may be necessary for a diagnosis when the service receives data through one of it s exposed methods it basically performs some processing and routes the data to a service associated with the data different data will result in different routing To ensure that the service runs as quickly as possible each cycle of receiving processing and routing of the data is handled by a seperate thread in the threadpool could this be a problem arising from one thread calling proxyClass Open whilst another is already using it would a lock block eliminate this problem if indeed this is the problem thanks guys ive been workikng on this project for too long and finally want to see the back of it but this appears to be the last stumbling block so any help much appreciated thanks for highlighting that i shouldn t be using the using construct for WCF proxy classes However the MSDN article isn t the most clearly written piece of literature ever so one quick question should i be using a proxy as such try client new proxy DataConnectorServiceClient client Open do work client Close catch more specific exceptions catch Exception e client Abort,csharp
Note that I m not actually doing anything with a database here so ORM tools are probably not what I m looking for I want to have some containers that each hold a number of objects with all objects in one container being of the same class The container should show some of the behaviour of a database table namely allow one of the object s fields to be used as a unique key i e other objects that have the same value in that field are not added to the container upon accepting a new object the container should issue a numeric id that is returned to the caller of the insertion method Instead of throwing an error when a duplicate entry is being requested the container should just skip insertion and return the key of the already existing object Now I would write a generic container class that accepts objects which implement an interface to get the value of the key field and use a HashMap keyed with those values as the actual storage class Is there a better approach using existing built in classes I was looking through HashSet and the like but they didn t seem to fit,java

I have a class that creates an object inside one public method The object is private and not visible to the users of the class This method then calls other private methods inside the same class and pass the created object as a parameter class Foo class A private typedef scoped_ptr lt Foo gt FooPtr void privateMethod1 FooPtr fooObj public void showSomethingOnTheScreen FooPtr fooObj new Foo privateMethod1 fooObj I believe the correct smart pointer in this case would be a scoped_ptr however I can t do this because scoped_ptr makes the class non copyable if used that way so should I make the methods like this void privateMethod1 FooPtr amp fooObj privateMethod1 doesn t store the object neither keeps references of it Just retrieves data from the class Foo The correct way would probably be not using a smart pointer at all and allocating the object in the stack but that s not possible because it uses a library that doesn t allow objects on the stack they must be on the Heap After all I m still confused about the real usage of scoped_ptr,cpp

I m running MySQL 5 1 and storing data from web logs into a table There is a datetime column which I want to partition by day Every night I add new data from the previous day into the table which is why I want to partition by day It is usually a few million rows I want to partition by day because it usually takes 20 seconds for a MySQL query to complete In short I want to partition by each day because users can click on a calendar to get web log information consisting of a day s worth of data The data spans millions of row for a single day The problem that I ve seen with a lot of partitioning articles is that you have to explicitly specify what values you want to partition for I don t like this way because it means that I ll have to alter the table every night in order to add an extra partition Is there a built in MySQL feature to do this for me automatically or will I have to write a bash script cron job to alter the table for me every night For example if I were to follow the following example http datacharmer blogspot com 2008 12 partition helper improving usability htmlIn one year I would have 365 partitions,mysql

It is the first time I m using SELECT queries without having an input I would like to check a table for duplicates As a result I only need to count the result So I have this SELECT field a field b field c FROM table WHERE a AND b AND c GROUP BY duplicatesHAVING COUNT duplicates gt 1would this check the table for duplicates when the structure is like field a field b field c a b c a b c d e fAnd how can I get the result Would it be just num_rows or do I get an integer as a result back from the query Normally I use num_rows to fetch the result from the query like that query db gt query SELECT result query gt num_rows if result 0 do something There usually should be a difference between num_rows and the result because if I would count by using num_rows it will return 2 because 2 have the condition a AND b AND cso I would think that the query from above would return 1 as a result for 1 duplicate found Or am I wrong Thanks alot,php
